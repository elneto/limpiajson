		"q1": "ECLAC has mainstreamed the 2030 Agenda and its follow-up in its main general governing bodies, particularly in the context of its Session of the Commission in which Commission's programme of work is presented and submitted to its Member states. As an example, at the XXXVI Session of the Commission in 2016, the 2030 Agenda was at the heart of both the programme and discussions of the meeting (https:\\/\\/periododesesiones.cepal.org\\/36\\/en). Moreover the Position Document presented to governments in this occasion entitled Horizons 2030: Equality at the centre of sustainable development  explicitly intertwined ECLAC's analysis and policy recommendations with the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda.    Also, at the request of member states, in April 2017 ECLAC held the first Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, the regional mechanism to follow up and review the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its means of implementation, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Each year ECLAC presents an Annual report on regional progress and challenges in relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (https:\\/\\/foroalc2030.cepal.org\\/2017\\/en\\/documents\\/annual-report-regional-progress-and-challenges-relation-2030-agenda-sustainable). Close to 800 participants representing 31 out of 33 governments of the region, 27 UN Entities, civil society, private sector and other stakeholders participated in a set of dialogues on eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world in the framework of sustainable development. Countries presenting their Voluntary National Review participated in peer learning sessions on topics revolving around institutional arrangements and the challenges related to the measurement of the SDG indicators, and the means of implementation, among others.  In their intergovernmentally agreed conclusions and recommendations, member-states reaffirmed their commitment to implement the agenda. It is important to note that these agreements, the report and the summary of the Chair are inputs to the the High-Level Political Forum. Through the modality of work adopted at its first meeting, the Forum proved to be the proper regional space for peer learning, sharing common experiences on the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. At the same time, it allowed for the participation of multiple regional stakeholders that differed from those normally participating at the global level.    With regards to the 2030 Agenda, ECLAC has identified in close consultation and dialogue with its Member States four key priority areas:     1) Supporting member States in the implementation, follow-up and review of the 2030 Development Agenda, including the SDGS through regional and inter-agency coordination. The establishment of the Forum of LAC countries on sustainable development is an important step in this direction since it will significantly unify the regional voices in global debates as well as enhance peer learning at the regional and sub-regional levels. The regional voice will in turn allow UN entities to identify national tasks to support country implementation.     2)  Promoting the integration of the SDGs into national and territorial planning, budgeting and investment schemes in collaboration with the UN-system at the regional and national levels;     3) Strengthening national capacities in statistics and indicators related to the measurement of SDGs in the context of the data revolution, with disaggregation, geospatial referencing and localization; and     4) Supporting the design and follow-up of means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the regional level and analyzing key policy interlinkages, on topics related to trade, financing for development, technology transfer, rules of engagement with the private sector, among others.      5) Provide a meaningful multistakeholder engagement platform. ECLAC is developing a course with UNITAR for Agenda 2030 implementers, diplomats and other stakeholders (private sector, civil society, etc.)      Implementing these priorities requires close coordination with UN entities at the regional and sub-regional levels.",
		"q2_1": "The programme of work and activities of ECLAC have gradually been adapted to meet the 2030 Development Agenda's main priorities. This entails framing topics previously developed (such as poverty, inequality, social protection, decent work, education, institutional analysis, youth, infancy, and disability among others) from the perspective of specific SDG's. Also new extra-budgetary projects have been designed in reference to the main priorities emerging from the 2030 Agenda.     In addition, in some of its latest main reports, ECLAC has developed a framework to analyze the social pillar of the Agenda and its linkages with the economic and environmental dimensions. More specifically, the position document presented in 2015 at the First Regional Conference on Social Development included a chapter addressing \\\\\\\"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the regional agenda for inclusive social development: Latin American and Caribbean challenges and synergies\\\\\\\". Finally, the position document presented in 2017 at the Second Regional Conference on Social Development also contained \\\\\\\"Chapter I. Equality at the centre of sustainable development \\\\\\\" developing the implications of the social dimension of the 2030 Agenda with its economic, environmental and institutional aspects, thus identifying an \\\\\\\"extended\\\\\\\" social pillar gathering specific goals that are essential to achieve advances in social development.     In March 2017 ECLAC organized an internal workshop called \\\\\\\"Mainstreaming gender in the 2030 Agenda: A commitment by ECLAC to women's rights and autonomy\\\\\\\" with the participation of directors and staff of the divisions and the sub-regional and national offices.     ECLAC Office in Bogot\\u00E1 has focused its studies on development lines related to the following SDGs:    1.\\\\tEradicate poverty (SDG 1) and reduce inequality (SDG 10): by analyzing the social protection system challenges in Colombia .   2.\\tPromote sustainable cities and communities (SDG 8): by its contribution to the government's Misi\\u00F3n del Sistema de Ciudades and Misi\\u00F3n para la transformaci\\u00F3n del campo, and by studying rural public goods, rural-urban linkages and territorial configurations for development .  3.\\tIndustry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9): by the elaboration of the Competitiveness ranking of Colombian departments (2000-2017).",
		"q2_2": "The creation of an interdivisional 2030 Agenda working group that has met every trimester since January 2014 in order to discuss multidisciplinary issues relevant to the work of ECLAC related to the 2030 Agenda and produce joint outputs.     ECLAC also has an interdivisional Working Group on Measuring SDG indicators.   ",
		"q2_3": "One example at ECLAC is the area of natural resources and infrastructure:  1.\\\\tThe reference to SDGs and Agenda 2030 were included in the work programme, ear-marking several analytical publications and expert meetings to the Agenda 2030 related issues.  2.\\tIn line with the indivisible nature of Agenda 2030, the cooperation between sectoral areas was intensified, resulting, inter alia, into identifying synergies between the infrastructure and a more sustainable use of natural resources  3.\\tPerformance indicators were adjusted to measure the progress in improving the infrastructure policies in line with the needs of the Agenda 2030  4.\\tIncreased attention is given to the issues of connectivity and access to infrastructure services at the national and regional level.",
		"q2_4": "In relation to advancing in \\\"leaving no one behind\\\", ECLAC has conducted important analytical work in order to identify some of the most important factors (socio-economic status, gender, age, territory and race and ethnicity ) contributing to social inequality in all realms and how they interact and often reinforce each other, in what has been described as a \\\"Social inequality matrix\\\". Also, this has involved a systematic effort to visualize the condition of people of African descent, a population group that is often ignored by public policies in Latin America. In that regard, the SDD has developed new statistical information and data, as well as policy and institutional recommendations that were recently summarized in the publication \\\"Situaci\u00F3n de las personas afrodescendientes en Am\u00E9rica Latina y desaf\u00EDos de pol\u00EDticas para la garant\u00EDa de sus derechos\\\". A similar effort is being conducted in relation to other population groups such as people with disabilities, youth, children (particularly in relation to child labour) and migrants.",

		"q3_1": "Further, in pursuant to the Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee (CDCC) Resolution 94(XXVI), ECLAC, through its subregional headquarters for the Caribbean is currently providing technical assistance to Member States in the development of integrated long-term development planning that incorporates the SDGs, the development of institutional frameworks for SDG implementation at the national level, and statistical capacity strengthening for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda.   The technical assistance activities being implemented by ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean are centered on the principle of \\\\\\\"leaving no one behind\\\\\\\" and are specifically targeted at integrated policy approaches.  These technical assistance activities are aimed at developing institutional capacities for integrating the SIDS development agenda, the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and national development priority in a holistic manner. Also, the CDCC, through resolution 94(XXVI) requested \\\\\\\"the secretariat of the Commission, through its subregional headquarters for the Caribbean and in collaboration with the relevant agencies of the United Nations system and the Caribbean Community, to provide the institutional support to facilitate synergy in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway at the national and regional levels.\\\\\\\"     Beginning in February 2018, ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean will implement a Development Account project on \\\\\\\"Strengthening institutional frameworks in the Caribbean for an integrative approach to implement the 2030 Agenda and the SIDS Sustainable Development Agenda.\\\\\\\" This project is designed to strengthen the institutional capacities of six Caribbean countries for national development planning and integrates the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SIDS agenda in the subregion.  Through this project, beneficiary countries will improve their capacities to design and implement evidence-based development planning and be better positioned to review and follow-up on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Proposed activities under this project include national assessments of the status of development plans and their implementation, national workshops on the process of development planning and integration of the 2030 Agenda, technical assistance in the integration of the SDGs and the SIDS agenda into long-term national development plans, national assessments of the capacity of national statistical systems to produce data for measuring progress in the implementation of the SDGs and the SIDS agenda, technical meetings to address the data requirements for monitoring the progress in implementation of the integrated national development plans, the design of a monitoring framework for adoption in beneficiary countries, and subregional workshops to facilitate peer learning among Caribbean countries.     Since planning is one mean of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the Latin-American and Caribbean Institute for Economic and Social planning fully incorporated the Agenda and the SDGs in its work plan to support Member States in the definition of development plans and strategies to achieve the SDG's.   It implied a thorough revision and update of both, the methodologies and contents of training courses as well as technical assistance tools.  It also implied the revision of the research agenda in order to mainstream the renewed global agreements.        In this context, several initiatives have been undertaken:      \\u2022\\\\tThe construction and launching of the Regional Observatory on Planning for Development of Latin America and the Caribbean.  This regional Observatory fostered a dynamic space for analysis, sharing of information and collective knowledge generation and sharing on planning for development and public management.   It is meant to support countries of Latin America and the Caribbean region in the strengthening and improvement of their planning systems and processes and to align their development planning efforts to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs according to their own priorities and national and subnational contexts and situations.    \\u2022\\tThe design and application of Planbar\\u00F3metro at national, regional and local levels in five different countries (Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Costa Rica).  It is a tool designed to improve the quality of planning processes assessing them under three different models (national, subnational and sectoral) five different dimensions (global, institutional, design, implementation, and results of the plan); three different context of analysis (system, process, tool) and 34 criteria including coordination, participation, stakeholder analysis, monitoring, among others.  Planbar\\u00F3metro also includes the criteria on SDGs alignment.      \\u2022\\tProgram for the strengthening of capacities on Planning for implementing the 2030 Agenda. The program aims at delivering tools and methodologies to support countries in their efforts to adapt the Agenda to their national and sub-national situations and generate plans and strategies to implement it.  The program has been already implemented in Guatemala, Honduras, by the regional government of Tucuman and by the Association of Caribbean States and has been co-organized, in each case, together with the governmental counterpart.      Different countries received assistance on the preparation of the national gender equality plans, which are correlated with the national development plans within the framework of the commitments adopted by the countries in regard to the 2030 Agenda. In 2017, ECLAC worked jointly with the governments of Chile and Costa Rica, in the process of the elaboration of their 2018-2030 national equality plans.For example, in the case of Chile, ECLAC gave technical support to the Women's Ministry in the development of a participatory methodology for preparing the national equality plan in the framework of the Montevideo Strategy and the SDGs.",
		"q3_2": "Natural resources and infrastructure  During the 2016 Ministerial Meeting in the occasion of the ECLAC Governance Week on Natural Resources and Infrastructure (7-11 November 2016), the ministerial delegations of Latin America and the Caribbean adopted a series of recommendations on infrastructure governance, which emphasized the cross-cutting linkages between infrastructure and sustainable development and SDGs and identified the actions to be carried out to enhance the infrastructure governance in the region in line with the needs of the 2030 Agenda.    ECLAC capacity building workshops on national logistics and mobility policies, carried out in twelve Latin American and Caribbean countries, provided a methodology and tools to link these national policies to progress on the implementation of SDGs. ECLAC also intensified the work on reliable indicators on infrastructure to measure the progress on SDG 9, which resulted in a launch of INFRALATAM \u2013 a joint ECLAC/IDB/CAF portal offering information on the past and current infrastructure investment levels in the ECLAC region.      In 2016 ECLAC launched the regional dialogue on infrastructure governance, whose overarching goal is to create a multi-level and multi-stakeholder partnerships and platforms and promote the national and regional policies for infrastructure development in line with the needs of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.     Related to SDG 6, ECLAC has produced the studies ",
		"q3_3": "ECLAC has gained enormous credibility in data analysis and statistical capacities and in the provision of technical assistance to countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region on best practices according to international norms and standards to support capacity-building for the improvement of collection, processing, disaggregation, comparability, dissemination of good quality data and statistics for evidence-based decision and policy-making. The Statistical Conference of the Americas (SCA), one of ECLAC's subsidiary bodies, has been key in providing methodological and technical support to countries in the region, upon request, in this respect and to address the challenges related to the measurement of indicators related to the SDGs.  Within the SCA there are 14 Working Groups comprised of UN entities and member States that deal with cross-cutting issues. The study on statistical capacities conducted by ECLAC in the framework of the SCA has been highly valued by countries in the region and has opened opportunities for collaboration with other entities of the UN system.      ECLAC as Secretariat of the Statistical Conference of the Americas (SCA), has promoted and organized the Regional Statistical Coordination Group for the 2030 Agenda, composed by the 10 LAC countries that are at the Global Level involved in the IAEG-SDG and HLG, elaborating a diagnosis of national capacities for SDG reporting, an online platform, a roadmap for closing the gaps with international and horizontal cooperation for statistical reporting, and now developing a Regional Monitoring Framework to follow up regional statistical trends and to help countries in elaborating their national voluntary reports.    Population & housing census is a key tool to be considered when facing the information challenges of the Agenda 2030. Its universal scope, i.e., involving each and every person living in one territory - the homes to which they belong and the dwellings they live - allow to gather significant information on the living conditions of the population, identifying those groups which must be the focus of sustainable development policies. Likewise, they constitute the basis for elaborating the sampling framework of surveys, and allow the calculation of indicators for small areas or specific population groups, without errors attributable to other sources of information that include sampling in its design. A revision made by the countries in the region in the framework of the Working Group on Censuses of the Statistical Conference of the Americas (for which ECLAC serves as Technical Secretary), has concluded that for several indicators included in the 2030 Agenda, the disaggregations stated in the SDG 17.18 can only be met based on census data, in particular for migrants,  indigenous peoples, afro descendant population and people with disabilities. Census data also represent the main source for indicators related to specific age groups or territories, and provide the denominator for a large number of indicators. In fact, given the regional heterogeneity, in some countries population and housing censuses can represent practically the only available source, as long as the surveys system and specially the continuous records are not improved.   ECLAC support to the countries in the region on census matters has a long history. In fact it has became a repository of census microdata bases, as an expression of the trust of countries towards the organization. Even though the region has a long tradition on censuses and there is a fair level of knowledge on the uncertainties of current census projects -some of them related to the complexity of methodological approaches, the topics considered and the technological development path for its implementation-, it is key to increase the efforts to maximize the benefits of census operations in the countries. It is worth noting that the timeframe of the 2030 Agenda coincides with the beginning of the 2020 round of census. Therefore, the censuses constitute a main source to define the baselines for monitoring the indicators and recording the progress towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. In parallel, a special scenario arises for developing a coordinated action with other data sources, by matching conceptual/operational definitions with general/specific surveys, and reinforcing the potential of the combined use with administrative records. In this sense, the indicators for the follow up of the SDGs constitute a priority issue in the current work plan of the Working Group on Censuses of the Statistical Conference of the Americas.  ECLAC also provides technical assistance on disability measurement and serves as the technical secretariat for the disability measurement working group of the Statistical Conference of the Americas. In this capacity, it organizes workshops to strengthen capacity on disability measurement for SDG follow up. For example, in June of 2017 ECLAC organized, in conjunction with the United Nations Statistics Division, a regional meeting that brought together representatives from the National Statistical Offices of Latin America  to engage in discussion on the way forward towards compilation and harmonization of data on disability for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals. This work will be on-going during the 2018-2019 biennium.     In conjunction with ILO, ECLAC provides technical assistance to Ministries of Work under the framework of the Latin American Free of Child Labour Regional Initiative in order to advance towards the elimination of child labour as stipulated in SDG 8.7. To date, technical assistance has been provided to five countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico) in applying a novel model to identify geographic areas that have a high probability of having child labour in order to better target policy aimed at its eradication.    ECLAC Office in Bogot\u00E1 has participated in the United Nations System-DANE working group on SDG, since its creation in 2016. The main activity was the preparation of the 1st Andean Congress on Data for the Sustainable Development Goals. The Congress highlighted many existing strengths and also highlighted the weaknesses or gaps that are still present in order to achieve the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs. As a result, the group elaborated a Road Map with the recommendations made by the theme tables, highlighting the role of the agencies and entities responsible for each SDG indicator, distributed in six key areas to strengthen national capacities: articulation of the different sources; interinstitutional coordination; capacity building; conceptual and methodological definition; definition of the most appropriate source and improvement of the means of capturing the information .      ECLAC's project of Apoyo a la implementaci\u00F3n de la Agenda 2030 para el Desarrollo Sostenible en Am\u00E9rica Latina y el Caribe (Support for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean) consists of a component that is dedicated to strengthening the capacities to close gender gaps in the policies for sustainable development in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). ECLAC has collaborated with Latin American and Caribbean countries on different projects, including in the area of women's economic autonomy. To continue with these efforts, ECLAC supports the countries of the region in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, focusing on gender mainstreaming and on actions needed to achieve the SDGs. The committed tasks include the strengthening of the production of statistics and gender indicators for monitoring, which contribute to the intersectoral work of the State and the incorporation of the gender perspective in different areas. In addition, gaps between men and women become visible through the production of gender statistics, evidencing the need for public actions that aim to close them, which is a key issue for the implementation and follow-up of the 2030 Agenda and its objectives.    ECLAC also processed, analyzed and disseminated SDG indicator 5.4.1 \\\"proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work\\\" and reported to the United Nations Statistics Division in New York to contribute to global monitoring.     In the framework of the Working Group on Gender Statistics, ECLAC provided technical assistance to the countries on the calculation of the monitoring indicators of the SDG 5 and the key indicators of others SDGs for gender equality such as the SDG 1, 8, 16, and others.    Finally, ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean is currently implementing a project on planning for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in six Caribbean countries (Aruba, the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Grenada, Guyana, and Sint Maarten.  This project addresses the institutional and capacity needs of the beneficiary countries' National Statistical System to produce data to support evidence-based policy planning and for the SDG indicators.  Activities under this project include assessment of the legal, institutional and organizational environment for the production of official statistics in beneficiary countries, meetings of data producers in each country to address obstacles to the production and dissemination of official statistics, and meetings of stakeholders in the public and private sectors, including civil society, youth and women organizations, to address the production of data for SDG indicators in each country.

		"q3_4": "ECLAC participated in a meeting \\\"International Consultation on Science, Technology and Innovation in the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Health-Related Goals\\\" in November 2017 that was co-organized by UN-DESA and Fundaci\u00F3n Oswaldo Cruz (Brazil), one of the world's leading public health research institutions. ECLAC has a Memorandum of Understanding with this latter entity in order to carry our projects and investigations related to development models, innovation and the 2030 Agenda as it pertains to health.     On December 2017, the Gender Summit on Science, Technology and Innovation for Latin America and the Caribbean was held on ECLAC's headquarters in Santiago, Chile. During the event, experts, politicians and business representatives discussed about the positive impacts of gender equity on science, technology and innovation for the region. On this opportunity, ECLAC gave the presentation on \\\"The use of the internet: Gender gaps and challenges for the economic autonomy of women in the digital age\\\" (El uso de internet: Brechas de g\u00E9nero y desaf\u00EDos para la autonom\u00EDa econ\u00F3mica de las mujeres en la era digital).    ECLAC has mainstreamed the Agenda 2030 into the Digital Agenda for Latin America and the Caribbean (eLAC2020). The latest version of the agenda will be approved at the sixth ministerial conference on information society, which will take place in April 2018 in Bogot\u00E1. The areas of gender, education and industrial development have been given special attention.  ",
		"q3_5": "ECLAC is the technical secretariat of the negotiation process for the regional agreement on access to information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean (Regional Agreement on Principle 10). Stemming from the Rio+20 Conference, the process began with the signing of the Declaration on the application of Principle 10 in Latin America and the Caribbean by 10 countries and currently includes 24 countries of the region. The negotiating committee, created in 2014, met on three occasions in 2017 and expects to conclude the negotiation of the regional agreement at its ninth meeting to be held in Costa Rica in February 2018. The Regional Agreement on Principle 10 places equality at the core of sustainable development and the agreement is at the heart of the 2030 Agenda. It aims to ensure that all persons, particularly those in vulnerable situations, have access to timely and reliable information, are able to participate significantly in those decisions that affect their lives and have access to justice in environmental matters, thus contributing to all SDGs and particularly SDG 16 (16.3, 16.6, 16.7 and 16.10, among others).     To showcase the link between Principle 10 and the 2030 Agenda, a poster was produced and is available at: https://www.cepal.org/sites/default/files/news/files/p10_ods_eng.pdf. Furthermore, a regional assessment on the implementation of access rights and their role towards the achievement of sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda is forthcoming.     Specific trainings on environmental access rights and the relationship between Principle 10 and the SDGs and other international agreements (i.e. Paris Agreement on Climate Change and SDG 13) have been carried out during 2017 in Grenada and Dominica, at the request of their respective governments. During those technical sessions, government officials and representatives of civil society organizations were in participation, including members of women, youth and indigenous groups. In Dominica, the technical assistance provided by ECLAC supported the discussions of the Climate Change, Environment and Natural Resources Bill.    ",

From 2014 to 2017, ECLAC ran the Development Account project: Strengthening national capacities to design and implement rights-based policies and programmes that address care of dependent populations and women's economic autonomy in urban development and planning. The project benefited the countries of Latin American and the Caribbean, and in particular, the seven cities that are at the core of the project: Bogot\u00E1 (Colombia); Mexico City (Mexico); Cuenca (Ecuador); Montevideo (Uruguay) Havana (Cuba); Santiago (Chile); San Salvador (El Salvador).    A relevant result of the project has been to incorporate the articulation between urban and care policies into the academic and political debate at the local level, as well as the expansion of the analysis, including empirical evidence, regarding the importance of the development and management of cities for the formulation of care programmes and services and their impact on women's economic autonomy. All the study cases and the lesson and knowledge learned on this project was a substantial material for a book published on December 2017 called \u00BFQui\u00E9n cuida en la ciudad?: aportes para pol\u00EDticas urbanas de igualdad (Who cares in the city? Contributions for urban policies of equality).  This project is synergic to the 2030 Agenda, as it recognizes gender equality and the autonomy of women as fundamental factors in moving towards sustainable development. The project is also accordance with the SDGs, specially with SDG 11 - make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable \u2013 and target 5.4 (recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies \u2026).    Also, ECLAC organized a course on Development planning and gender perspective for staff of the different local governments of the region.     During the Conference of the Cities in 2017 (Santiago) a capacity building workshop on sustainable urban development was implemented with the participation of several countries of the region. ECLAC is providing technical assistance to cities in disaster risk management \u2013 in Baranquilla (Colombia), Angra dos Reis (Brasil) and Chacabuco (Chile)- and a capacity building project for monitoring of urban SDGs in conjunction with UN Habitat (2 countries TBD) is planned for 2018.    In Argentina, an adaptation of ECLAC's gap analysis methodology  at the subnational level was applied aligned with the 2030 Agenda. This methodology has been applied in two provinces  (see http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/40836/1/S1601120_es.pdf  and  http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/42075/1/S1700688_es.pdf), and plans are being developed to apply it in two more, with the goal of establishing sub national baselines for some SDGs in the country.

		"q3_7": "The Montevideo Consensus on Population and Development \u2013resulting from the first session of the Regional Conference on Population and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Montevideo in August, 2013\u2013 is the most important agreement among Governments signed in the region regarding Population and Development matters, and has become a key part of the review process of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and its follow up beyond 2014. This is clearly reflected in Resolution 2014/1 of the Commission on Population & Development of the United Nations which took note of the final documents arising from the regional conferences on population and development.   In response to the need of making the Consensus, an operational agenda, the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference decided, during its first meeting held in November 2014, to create an Operational guide for the implementation and follow-up of the Montevideo Consensus on Population and Development, and present it as its contribution to the second session of the Regional Conference, in Mexico City, October 2015. The Guide represented an initial effort  to create synergies with the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   Likewise, the second session of the Regional Conference decided to create an Ad Hoc Working Group in charge of preparing a proposal on indicators for the regional follow up of the Montevideo Consensus, taking into account those indicators defined for the SDGs. The final list of indicators, included in the final report of the working group, was approved during the extraordinary meeting of the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference, held in Santiago in November 2017 (See attached document, Informe Final Indicadores CRPD.pdf). It is important to highlight that nearly a third of the indicators included in the proposal correspond to SDGs. Thus, the regional follow up of the Montevideo Consensus has acquired a fundamental role in the monitoring process of the 2030 Agenda implementation in the region, in line with the resolution on the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, adopted during the thirty-sixth session of ECLAC in May 2016.  Therefore, the Regional Conference is a key component of the architecture for the implementation and follow-up of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Montevideo Consensus a valuable tool for advancing towards equality as promoted by ECLAC. The implementation and follow up of the Consensus shall reinforce the links between global and regional, promote cooperation among countries, and foster national capacity building, thus contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in the region.  For the XIII Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean (RCW), held in Montevideo in October 2016, ECLAC prepared the position document Equality and women's autonomy in the sustainable development agenda. The document presents a regional proposal on public policies' potential to achieve substantive gender equality in the countries of the region within the framework of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. The document also proposes the mainstreaming of the gender perspective in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by cataloging the level of impact of each goal. The document was distributed among the countries and well received by different stakeholders participating at the XIII RCW. Its diagnosis and proposals were an input for the debates on gender equality and the 2030 Agenda at the national level after the RCW. At the XIII RCW governments agreed that the Regional Gender Agenda complements the SDG and is a guide for achieving sustainable development from the perspective of gender equality, rights and women's autonomy in Latin America and the Caribbean.    As a result of the RCW, the governments adopted the Montevideo Strategy for Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, a roadmap for implementing the 2030 Agenda and for designing policies and programmes to achieve sustainable development with gender equality. The Montevideo Strategy strengthens the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with measures in 10 implementation pillars with a view to ending discrimination against women, avoiding setbacks and moving towards substantive equality. Costa Rica as Vice-Chair of the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference on Women participated at the First meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development and delivered a presentation on the contribution of the RCW to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and potential synergies and complementarities.     During the Fifty-fifth Meeting of the Presiding Officers of the RCW, 14 countries reported on the application of the Montevideo Strategy at national level and its contribution to achieve SDG. Governments agreed to:  \\\"Reaffirm the commitment to mainstream the gender perspective and women's autonomy and rights, in line with the Regional Gender Agenda and the Montevideo Strategy, into all the Sustainable Development Goals, their targets, indicators and means of implementation, in order to take advantage of this window of opportunity for institutional strengthening of machineries for the advancement of women\\\" (See report: http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/42120/S1700853_en.pdf)       Governments also reiterated \\\"their commitment to designing and implementing gender plans and policies that are coordinated with national sustainable development strategies and have targets, indicators and adequate budgets\\\".  (See report: http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/42120/S1700853_en.pdf )      In accordance with these agreements, ECLAC organized during the Fifty-sixth meeting of the Presiding Officers of the RCW a High-level panel on the implementation of gender equality plans in the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development where governments shared their experiences, lesson learnt and challenges. Strengthening the institutional architecture and intersectoral work, promoting a participatory process, securing resources, and the implementation of follow-up and monitoring systems were highlighted as key aspects in the design of gender equality plans within the framework of sustainable development.    In this occasion, governments reaffirmed \\\"the commitment to strengthen the capacities of the machineries for the advancement of women to enter into dialogue and ensure coordination with different government bodies, in particular with ministries of the economy, with a view to mainstreaming the gender perspective in economic policies and budgets, and with ministries of foreign affairs in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\\\" (See Agreements, https://www.cepal.org/sites/default/files/events/files/agreements_1.pdf).    Finally, ECLAC prepared a document on the interconnections between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Regional Gender Agenda with recommendations to advance towards a comprehensive implementation of gender equality and women's autonomy public policies. The publication \\\"The 2030 Agenda and the Regional Gender Agenda: Synergies for equality in Latin America and the Caribbean\\\" has been widely disseminated at intergovernmental meetings such as the 61st session of the Commission on the Status of Women and the First Meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, the Fifty-Fifth Meeting of the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean, and its main findings have been incorporated in Division for Gender Affairs presentations delivered to governments, civil society and other stakeholders.

		"q5": "Regional Coordination Mechanism (RCM)  The meeting of the RCM is convened annually by ECLAC, either in its Headquarters in Santiago, Chile, or in another location agreed upon jointly with the Office of the Deputy Secretary-General (DSG) and the representatives from UN regional funds, programmes and specialized agencies in Latin America and the Caribbean. When relevant, the meeting is convened back-to-back with a UNDG meeting.   The meeting traditionally starts with opening remarks from the DSG and welcoming remarks from the Executive Secretary of ECLAC. The DSG provides an overview of the main priorities of the UN development agenda at the global and regional levels, emphasising the highlights and outcomes of recent global summits related to the development agenda and of the most recent high-level segment of the General Assembly in New York, stressing the main commitments made and follow-up actions. Emphasis is placed on the global and regional dimensions of the internationally agreed development goals and, since 2015, on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Accord on Climate Change. The RCM enables to identify complementarities between upcoming global and regional efforts with the work of the UN system. The Executive Secretary of ECLAC provides a reading of the main trends and challenges of the regional development agenda in the economic, social and environmental spheres and on the main outcomes of the regional inter-governmental bodies for which ECLAC acts as technical secretariat as well as the outcomes of regional preparatory events for global summits, in many cases in collaboration with other entities of the UN Development System in the region.   Against this backdrop, the regional heads of UNDS entities present the perspective from each entity of the regional context, followed by a discussion on the need to jointly assess and rethink the positioning of the UN system in order to respond to current challenges and achieve optimal support and relevance, with sustainability and equality at the center of the agenda, and in collaboration with all stakeholders in the region. An emphasis is placed on strengthening inter-agency coordination and leave competition aside.  In preparation for the first meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, that took place in Mexico City on 26-28 April 2017, ECLAC convened a RCM in Panama City of August 30 2016 to review the proposed program and discuss the participation of UNDS entities in the Forum and their contributions to the \\\"Annual report on regional progress and challenges in relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean\\\". A document was produced to capture all contributions entitled \\\"Contributions of the United Nations System to the First Annual Report on Regional Progress and Challenges in Relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean\\\".   ECLAC's collaboration with other UN entities  Starting in 2017, ECLAC through its Population Division (CELADE) is leading the Development Account project Demographic transition: opportunities and challenges to achieve the SDGs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Co-operating Entities within the UN system are UNFPA-LACRO, DESA-Population Division.  The project is designed to improve the capacity of policymakers in selected Latin American and Caribbean countries to assess the opportunities and challenges brought by the demographic transition to advance towards the SDGs. In particular, to improve the design of public policies aiming to fully benefit from the demographic dividend in preparation for the challenges posed by the advent of population ageing.  Latin American and Caribbean countries are currently in the midst of a demographic transition which will lead to a dramatic shift in the age structure of the population, with sharp declines in the proportion of children and increases in the proportion of older persons. Since people's economic activities are strongly linked to their stage in the life cycle, changes in population age structure have an important impact on economic development.   Equally profound is the transformation in traditional gender roles which is accompanying the region's demographic transition, clearly evident in the rising participation of women in formal labour markets. Critically, both transformations are occurring in the context of high and persistent inequality in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Although countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are at various stages in their demographic transition, most of them are experiencing a period that is particularly conducive to economic development known as the demographic dividend, in which the proportion of working-age people increases relative to the rest of the population. This economically favourable period can contribute to accelerated progress toward SDGs.   This beneficial period will be followed \u2013sooner in some countries and later in others\u2014 by a period of rapid population ageing that will pose new social and economic challenges which can impede progress toward SDGs.  Taking advantage of the opportunities and responding to the new challenges presented by the demographic transition during the SDG period require forward-looking policies which take account of population dynamics. Progress toward achievement of SDG targets is inseparably linked to population trends.  The project builds upon a well-established methodology that was developed in the context of the international National Transfer Accounts (NTA) Project. The NTA system measures the flow of economic resources between age groups in a manner consistent with National Income and Product Accounts using an international standard:  the United Nations National Transfer Accounts Manual (United Nations, 2013). NTAs -- by providing a framework for understanding the impact of changing age structures on national economies -- allow us to integrate population dynamics into sustainable development planning.  The project will also incorporate the analysis of National Time Transfer Accounts (NTTAs), in collaboration and with the technical support from the Counting Women's Work (CWW) project, as a means for valuing the non-remunerated activities, aiming at measuring the value of time transfers between individuals. International comparisons of this data will yield a rich source of information not only about the magnitude of the gender dividend but also about changes in gender specialization in economies over time, progress toward gender equality, and measurement of the hidden \\\"care economy\\\" \u2013 most especially the provision of time-intensive transfers to young children and elderly.  The Regional Conference of Social Development is jointly organized by ECLAC with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Other UN agencies have been invited to participated through side-events and official representation. For instance, at the II Regional Conference of Social Development of 2017, UNESCO, ILO and UNICEF took part of the activities programmed (https://crds.cepal.org/2/en/programme).     The ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean is actively participating in the Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) Missions of the UNDG in the Caribbean.  In particular, ECLAC has conducted assessments of Data and Statistics for SDG implementation and monitoring in Aruba and Trinidad and Tobago that formed part of the SDG Roadmap for these countries.  These assessments have highlighted significant shortcomings in the statistical systems of the two countries and have prompted renewed efforts by the respective government to strengthen the data ecosystem in order to facilitate the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda. The mechanism of assigning specific task areas to different UN agencies participating in the MAPS mission is a good template for inter-agency collaboration and has facilitated the successful conduct of MAPS mission in the Caribbean.  The implementation of the Development Account project on \\\"Strengthening institutional frameworks in the Caribbean for an integrative approach to implement the 2030 Agenda and the SIDS Sustainable Development Agenda,\\\" scheduled to start in February 2018, with be done by ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean in collaboration with the SIDS Unit of UN DESA.      Together with UNITAR and the Government of Colombia, ECLAC co-organized a regional meeting on the Integrated implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda in Latin America.  The international meeting aimed at providing a forum for discussing challenges and potential solutions on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the national and local levels.  Furthermore, the meeting sought to learn on the different and existent tools and methodologies as well as good practices to promote the \\\"whole of the government and whole of society focus in the planning, monitoring, evaluating and financing the achievement of the SDGs at the national and local levels.   The activity involved the active participation of UNDP, UNDESA, Public Administration Institute of Spain, and the Spanish Agency of International Cooperation for Development.    ECLAC is a member of the Inter-agency and Expert Group (IAEG) on Gender Statistics led by UNSD. For that reason, ECLAC participated in UNSD's last meetings on the methodological and conceptual discussions on SDGs monitoring indicators. ECLAC attended and actively participated in the IAEG 9th meeting held in Bangkok in November 2015, which reviewed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators proposed under Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, and also attended the 11th Meeting of the IAEG and Expert Group on Gender Statistics held in Rome in November 2017 in which reviewed the methodological developments in key areas of gender concerns in the SDG framework, an also shared regional efforts to strengthen capacities in the production of statistics with a gender perspective.    From 29 November to 1 December 2017, UNECE promoted a Work Session on Gender Statistics on Belgrade, Serbia, for discussing the measuring and valuing of unpaid care work, the production of gender-oriented indicators for monitoring the 2030 Agenda and the dissemination and communication of gender statistics for the SDGs. ECLAC attended this event and presented a paper on gender mainstreaming and another on time distribution and inequality. The first presentation was about the article Mainstreaming Gender in Sustainable Development Goals in Latin America and the Caribbean. This paper gave an over view of the regional actions on gender mainstreaming, and more specifically the Montevideo Strategy for Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, a regional political commitment that aims at guiding the full implementation of the agreements adopted by countries on the Regional Gender Agenda and to make them the road map for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the regional level from the perspective of gender equality and women's autonomy and human rights.     The second presentation was about the paper Time distribution: a key element of the inequality analysis which analyzes thought time-use data, the dimensions of inequality in the region and how they interconnect. In addition, it presents a non-exhaustive research and recommendation agenda for public policies, highlighting the potential use of time-use and distribution data for equality policies from a gender perspective.    ECLAC participated at the 61st. Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), whose priority was ",
		"q6": "ECLAC has worked with the Latin American Union Organization (CSA) not only to raise awareness on the Agenda and its potential for multi-stakeholder involvement, but also to align the Union's workplan and strategies with the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.  Unions are not familiar with the 2030 Agenda and it is of utmost importance to involve them in the discussion regarding the future of employment. For this reason, ECLAC provided two capacity building activities in Ecuador and Peru in 2017 with CSA members.  ECLAC is one of the co-organizers of ConCausa, an initiative to engage youth of Latin America and the Caribbean in the 2030 Agenda. In conjunction with UNICEF and Am\u00E9rica Solidaria, a regional NGO, this initiative seeks to identify and disseminate information on projects that youth 15 to 17 years of age in Latin America and the Caribbean are carrying out in their communities to support the implementation the 2030 Agenda. In this way, the initiative seeks to highlight the important contribution of youth, as agents of change, in the implementation of the agenda.    ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean is currently implementing a project on planning for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in six Caribbean countries (Aruba, the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Grenada, Guyana, and Sint Maarten).  Activities under this project have focused on stakeholder engagement in the implementation and follow-up and review of the SDGs in beneficiary countries.  Lessons learned in executing this project show that many government ministries and department are still unaware of their role in the implementation and follow-up and review of the SDGs.  Also, the private sector and civil society organizations seem enthused about the SDGs but are generally unclear about how they could contribute in implementing and monitoring the SDGs.      In May 2017, ECLAC held an International Fair Trade Meeting in the Plurinational State of Bolivia on the theme ",
		"q7": "In November 2016, it was organized in Panam\u00E1 the workshop \\\"The 2020 round of census: potentialities and challenges for the Sustainable Development Goals and the Montevideo Consensus in the framework of the Agenda 2030\\\". The workshop was aimed to facilitate exchange of experiences and technical discussions among the Latin American countries that are preparing their censuses for the next few years, in order to analyze the scope and limitations of the population and housing censuses for the  co-ordinated follow up of the indicators of the 2030 Agenda (SDGs) and the Montevideo Consensus.   Every two years, ECLAC organizes the Regional Conference of Social Development and, each year it holds a Meeting of the Presiding Officers of the Conference to follow-up on its proceedings. The following Meeting is expected to take place in November 2018 in Panama.    ECLAC is organizing in 2018 a series of seminars addressing issues such as: social institutions, migration and social protection, and the role of ICT's in social protection management, among others. These meetings will gather experts and representatives from governments and contribute to mutual learning.    ECLAC implemented the following activities in the Caribbean:  1.\\tCaribbean symposium on mainstreaming the SDGs in national development planning (14-16 February 2017, Kingston, Jamaica).The outcome of this symposium pointed to the lack of an institutional framework for SDG implementation and data gap as major hindrances to an early implementation of the 2030 Agenda in most Caribbean countries.  2.\tWorkshop to accelerate the Sustainable Development Goals implementation in the Caribbean (18 May 2017, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago). This workshop highlighted the significance of an institutional framework for SDG implementation and proposed a model institutional framework for consideration by Member States of the Caribbean.    3.\tSubregional workshop on implementing evidence-based policy planning for sustainable development (13-14 December 2017, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago). Participants at this workshop acknowledged the importance of data in policy planning, implementation, and monitoring and reporting and requested that ECLAC provides further technical assistance at the national level in implementing evidence-based approaches to policy planning.  4.\tIn collaboration with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Secretariat and the SIDS Unit of UN DESA, ECLAC implemented an Expert Group Meeting (EGM) for the development of a set of core indicators for monitoring implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the SAMOA Pathway in Caribbean Small Island developing States (6-9 December 2016, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago). The concept of a core set of SDG indicators for the Caribbean was developed at this EGM which led to the establishment of a Technical Working Group (TWG) by CARICOM.  This TWG has now finalized a draft core set of 109 SDG indicators, from the global SDG indicator framework, that would be considered as the minimum set for Caribbean countries to report on.    The 1st Andean Congress on Data for the Sustainable Development Goals was held in Bogot\u00E1 on March 22, 23 and 24th, 2017 . It was centered around five main topics: Partnerships, Planet, People, Prosperity and Peace. The working plan received contributions from at least 15 Ministries of the Government of Colombia, 300 participants (from Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana and Surinam), and UN officials and experts, among others. ECLAC worked with the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00EDstica (DANE) in the \\\"Partnerships\\\" topic. A lesson learnt is to keep working on the recommendations provided by the working group, by taking action on each indicator and follow up the progress and the responsible entities in order to avoid leaving those conclusions just in paper.        In December 2016, an international seminar on international trade and climate change with a focus on the environmental sustainability of exports was held in Santiago, Chile. The seminar presented an overview of the most recent multilateral and regional environmental initiatives, as well as the opportunities and obstacles that these could imply for exports from Latin America and the Caribbean. International experts and public and private actors involved in matters related to international trade and environmental sustainability participated in this meeting. In the 2018-19 biennium, ECLAC will be organizing two expert meetings to consider the relationship between regional trade and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and two studies on the linkages between trade and the Sustainable Development Goals in the region. In addition, ECLAC will provide technical cooperation services to countries from Latin America and the Caribbean, business and trade promotion organizations and other stakeholders, at their request, in areas relating to trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.    Seminar on Accountability systems for measuring, monitoring and reporting on sustainable city policies in Latin America: The Seminar co-organized by ECLAC and UN Habitat in September 2017, as part of the joint Development Account project of the same title, brought together 6 participating cities from Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. The project focuses on building local capacity to support accountability on city policies, using the SDGs and specifically SDG 11 to frame local policy demands and action. The seminar discussed good practices on accountability, transparency and open government initiatives at the city level and how this drive urban sustainability policies. Participating cities also shared their experiences and mapped challenges to be addressed by the project.    Cities Conference: One year on from Habitat III, in Octobrer 2017 the Cities Conference organized by ECLAC focused on the implementation of the New Urban Agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean for inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities. The conference was composed of 4 sub-events, addressing different dimensions of sustainable urban development and involving a broad range of stakeholders.    Resilient Cities in Latin America and the Caribbean: Key Concepts, Experiences and Projections: This segment of the conference formed part of the collaboration between ECLAC and the German Cooperation (GIZ), as part of the project \\\"Global Initiative on Disaster Risk Management.\\\" The event focused on urban resilience and disaster risk management, a key aspect of the New Urban Agenda and SDG11. The segment concluded with a dialogue supported by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC Canada) about how to reduce barriers and gaps to access financing in order to build resilient cities in LAC in the context of climate change.    Implementing the New Urban Agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean with the Regional Action Plan:  ECLAC, in collaboration with UN Habitat and MINURVI \u2013 General Assembly of Ministers and High Authorities of Housing and Urban Development of Latin America and the Caribbean developed a Regional Action Plan to implement the New Urban Agenda, as well as a Subregional Action Plan focused on the Caribbean. The Plan was presented at the event and the governance, financing and monitoring of its implementation was addressed. The meeting also analyzed the proposal for a Latin American and Caribbean Urban and Cities Platform to house both urban data and policy experiences, which is currently under development with different stakeholders and partners.    Public-Private Dialogue for Promoting Urban Sustainability in Latin America and the Caribbean: With the support of the French Government, ECLAC organized a dialogue to foster a renewed approach to the role of public private partnerships (PPPs) in urban sustainability. The event discussed how more efficient collaboration between public and private actors can be achieved to implement sustainable projects in urban areas in Latin America and the Caribbean. Additionally, the dialogue sought to reflect on how emerging technologies can be leveraged to create more inclusive and sustainable cities.The dialogue emphasized the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration on urban sustainability and capacity development for mutually beneficial PPPs. A second dialogue is likely to be organized to deepen the discussion on some of these themes.    Moving towards the Implementation of Safe, Affordable and Sustainable Urban Mobility in Latin America and the Caribbean. This segment of the Cities Conference was co-organized by ECLAC and the Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT), with the support of the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Development Bank of Latin American (CAF) and GIZ-BMZ in the framework of the project \\\"Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative\\\". The sessions analyzed opportunities to support a more systematic and accelerated implementation of safe, affordable and sustainable urban mobility in LAC, as part of the implementation of the Regional Action Plan and global agreements (Paris Agreement, SDGs, New Urban Agenda). This event is likely to become an annual meeting of mobility experts and professionals hosted at ECLAC.    ECLAC has organized events that have contributed to facilitate exchange of experiences and mutual learning regarding climate change related policies among them:    \uF0A7\tThe Horizontal Cooperation Workshop on Public Policies \\\"Peruvian innovation for the internalization of climate risks in public investment projects\\\" with the attendance of Government representatives of Chile, Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Colombia, Costa Rica and Uruguay and Peru. In this event, officials of the Ministries of Economy and Finance and Environment of Peru shared their experience about their  National System of Public Investment and on how risk management associated with climate change where included in the estimation of the social rate of return for the evaluation of public investment projects.  -The regional workshop \\\"Models of Development and Climate Change\\\" were organized as a response to a request from the Ministry of Housing, Territorial Planning and Environment of Uruguay for discussion and exchange of experiences that would contribute to the construction of its National Policy of Climate Change. In this workshop representatives of eight Latin American countries shared their experiences on priority issues for the Government of Uruguay such as Development Styles, Sustainable and resilient low carbon transportation, and climate finance. The representatives of the participating countries gave orientations and recommendations for the construction of Uruguay's National Climate Change Policy based on the successful experiences and the barriers experienced in the construction of their countries' climate change policies.  \uF0A7\tOn the other hand, ECLAC and UN Environment have organized five meetings of negotiators for climate change in the last years in order to contribute to the discussion and analysis of the different points of view that the countries of Latin America have before the Conference of the Parties on climate change.    ECLAC also serves as the Secretariat for the Principle 10 regional process that has held 9 meetings to date and always include a session for reporting national actions and developments taken by countries on information, participation and justice in environmental matters, offering an opportunity to share experiences and lessons learned. In addition, the meetings generally include side events and training workshops. Furthermore, the Observatory on Principe 10 showcases laws, regulations and policies on environmental matters and access rights.     In line with the resolution entitled \\\"Financial inclusion for sustainable development\\\" (A/C.2/72/L.51), ECLAC held five national seminars (Mexico, July 2016; Colombia, October 2016; Ecuador, Octobe, 2016; Costa Rica, November 2017 and Brazil, November 2017) and four regional seminars (Mexico, April 2017; Peru, August 2017; Thailand, September 2017 and Chile, October 2017). These events discussed from a national and regional perspective the state of financial inclusion of Small and Medium Enterprises, and the role of development banks in fostering innovative instruments, practices and institutions to foster financial inclusion. Financial inclusion is viewed as a policy of productive development.          Recent events conducted by ECLAC with regards to Financing for Development include:  \u2022\tA workshop entitled \\\"La Agenda 2030 para el Desarrollo Sostenible y los desaf\u00EDos del financiamiento para el desarrollo\\\" held in October 2016. The purpose of the meeting was to raise awareness among policymakers in Central America of the issues addressed in the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean 2016: 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the challenges of financing for development.  \u2022\tA seminar entitled \\\"Protection and Training: Institutions for the Improvement of Labour Market Integration in Latin America and Asia\\\" in October 2016 which brought together stakeholders from Latin America and Asia to share experiences in the field of technical and vocational education and training. Emphasis was made on new challenges emerging due to profound technological change and the corresponding transformations of labor markets and skill demand.  \u2022\tA seminar in November 2016 entitled \\\"Public budgets and the Sustainable Development Goals in Latin America\\\" that allowed policymakers in the region to share experiences related to the incorporation of the SDGs into their budgetary processes.  \u2022\tThe Fiscal Panorama of Latin America and the Caribbean 2017: Mobilizing resources to finance sustainable development was launched during the XXIX Regional Seminar on Fiscal Policy held in March 2017. The seminar included a special high-level panel that counted with the participation of Ministers and Vice-ministers from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Honduras and Uruguay which discussed the findings of the report and the challenges for financing the 2030 Agenda in the region.  \u2022\tAn expert meeting in October 2017 entitled \\\"\u00BFC\u00F3mo dinamizar el crecimiento econ\u00F3mico de Am\u00E9rica Latina y el Caribe?\\\" which resulted in a very fruitful South-South sharing of experiences around the issues treated in the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean 2017: Dynamics of the current economic cycle and policy challenges for boosting investment and growth.    These events were successful in generating South-South dialogue in these areas because they carefully targeted the stakeholders who are most associated with formulating and enacting policies. Another key lesson learned was that the quality of the discussion in the expert meetings was significantly improved by having the events linked to analytical work produced by ECLAC, which helped to provide a context for the discussions. Finally, these events also served to identify areas of particular interest in the region for future work such as improvements in the institutionality of public investment as a crucial area for future technical assistance.    The 2016 Ministerial Meeting at the occasion of the ECLAC Governance Week on Natural Resources and Infrastructure (7-11 November 2016), adopted a series of recommendations on infrastructure governance, which emphasized the cross-cutting linkages between infrastructure and sustainable development and SDGs and identified the actions to be carried out to enhance the infrastructure governance in the region in line with the needs of the 2030 Agenda. These actions include analytical work, technical assistance and supporting a systematic and regular high level policy dialogue on infrastructure governance.     In December 2017, ECLAC organized in Argentina the \\\"VIII Regional Political Dialogue on Energy Efficiency\\\", with the participation of high-level government representatives from 15 countries of the Region and 7 international agencies of the energy sector. Among other topics, the challenges and opportunities related to the SDG7 process in the Region were discussed. The \\\"achievement of the SDG7\\\" will be the theme of the Regional ROSE launch meeting, scheduled for the first half of 2018. On this occasion, ECLAC presented its document \\\"Advances in sustainable energy in Latin America and the Caribbean \" prepared within the framework of the GTF process (Global Tracking Framework) linked to the Sustainable Energy for All program (SE4All).     During the thirty-sixth session of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), held in Mexico City from 23 to 27 May 2016, the member States adopted Resolution 700 (XXXVI), Mexico Resolution, which established the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development as the regional mechanism to follow up and review the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its means of implementation, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The Economic and Social Council subsequently endorsed the establishment of the Forum in its resolution 2016/12.    In accordance with the mandate of paragraph 10 of resolution 70/299, which encourages UN member States to identify the most appropriate regional or sub-regional forums and formats to contribute to the HLPF global process of follow-up and review and draws attention on the need to avoid duplications, through the conceptualization of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, Member States of Latin America and the Caribbean made an important effort to develop a space under the auspices of ECLAC for convergence and dialogue for all the relevant actors of the region that would strengthen the global processes and at the same time complement it; a meeting space that could allow governments and relevant stakeholders to share best practices and jointly address the gaps and challenges that countries face in their respective processes of implementation, follow-up and review of the SDGs.      Acknowledging the contents of the Intergovernmentally agreed Conclusions and Recommendations of the first meeting of the LAC Forum, it becomes clear that ECLAC has provided a connective tissue between the global and the national and local levels and offered pertinent regional perspectives on global issues, consolidating the bases of a regional platform for the follow up and review of progress of the SDGs in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the institutional bases for the analysis of existing and emerging regional and national challenges, actively engaging the broader UN development system in the process.    The First Meeting of the LAC Forum can now be seen as the first step of an ongoing process of follow up and review of the 2030 Agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean.  In the years to come ECLAC will hold the responsibility of making this relevant first step become a consolidated regional process, capable of integrating the finding and achievements of each cycle and thus allowing relevant progressive improvements towards the achievement of the SDGs at the regional and the national and local levels.",
		"q8": "The Outlook for Agriculture and Rural Development in the Americas: A Perspective on Latin America and the Caribbean 2017-2018. Joint report by the Inter American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture, The Economic Comission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the United Nations Organization for Food and Agriculture. San Jose, Costa Rica.  It contains a special chapter on Food systems and the 2030 Agenda. http://repositorio.cepal.org/handle/11362/42282      ECLAC produces a yearly Social Panorama of Latin America which examines poverty and inequality trends in the region while also exploring other specific issues. As an example, the latest two versions of the Social Panorama have addressed inequalities in the distribution of income (personal and functional) and property, inequalities over the life cycle , time-use inequalities between men and women, and the situation of Afrodescendent populations as an example of ethnic and racial inequalities (2016 edition); as well as income inequality between individuals and households, the evolution of poverty and its determinants, and the effects of pension systems on equality  (2017 edition).      ECLAC published the document The 2030 Agenda and the Regional Gender Agenda Synergies for equality in Latin America and the Caribbean.  This paper analyses the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals in light of the challenges and priorities for gender equality and women's rights and autonomy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Examples are presented to illustrate the interconnections between the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda and to underscore the importance of taking an integrated approach in order to ensure that progress on some Sustainable Development Goals is not achieved by means that could impede the attainment of goals and targets associated with gender equality and women's rights. This paper concludes that the Regional Gender Agenda provides a roadmap for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in Latin America and the Caribbean through the implementation of public policies that link up the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and contribute to the eradication of gender inequalities and inequalities within and among countries.

		"q1": "FAO's mandate is to end hunger and malnutrition across the globe through sustainable agriculture sustainably managing, preserving and restoring natural resources and ecosystems.   The adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, recognizing the role of food and agriculture systems in addressing the complex set of challenges of sustainable development, provided the opportunity for better integration across different dimensions of FAO's work, and improvement of its programme of work, policy deliberations, and mobilization of resources and capacities, as well as for identifying and strengthening of partnerships with different stakeholders. FAO technical and governing bodies have played a key role in providing guidance and identifying priorities of FAO contribution to the SDGs.   The FAO Conference, main decision making body, ultimately approving the FAO vision, policies and programme of work, was informed by Technical (thematic) bodies (Committees on Fishery, Forest, Agriculture, Trade and Commodity),  The Committee on World Food Security, the FAO Regional Conferences, and other intergovernmental platforms of/hosted by FAO such as the Commission on Genetic Resources for food and agriculture, the Codex Alimentarius, the International Treaty of plant and genetic resources, all discussing policy, programmatic and financial priorities of FAO work on SDGs in specific agenda items during 2016/2017 sessions. Technical and regional bodies, as well as the programme and finance committees also discussed ways to fully integrate SDGs into the  programme of work and the results framework of FAO.    The Medium Term Plan 2018-21 and Programme of Work and Budget 2018-19, approved by FAO Conference in July 2017, fully incorporate SDGs at targets, outcomes and outputs level and  monitors results achieved by the Organization through a wide set of SDG indicators. These two core documents will guide the contribution of the Organization to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the next four crucial years through a holistic approach to address the complex and interconnected challenges posed by the SDGs.    The Conference recommended FAO to further strengthen support provided to national stakeholders, so as to ensure that food and agriculture are prominently reflected in the nationally identified priorities, as well as to enhancing national stakeholders' capacity on monitoring and reporting and encouraged the Secretariat to monitor progress on engagement in the 2030 Agenda, including through provision of reports to the United Nations High-level Political Forum.    As mentioned before, the Technical Committees and the Regional Conferences of FAO have discussed and provided policy guidance vis a vis the Agenda, sharing a common position along the following lines: Food and agriculture are critical to achieving the SDGs, allowing for integrated approaches and addressing challenges of sustainable development in its three dimensions. In fact, the sustainable development of food and agriculture systems is recognized as a key enabler for SDG implementation, and identified as priority cross-cutting issue in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, identifying the financial and non-financial means of implementation for the 2030 Agenda, and complementing SDG 17, dedicated to the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development and Means of Implementation.   A strong focus on rural development ensures that no one is left behind, contributing to eradication of poverty, still mainly concentrated in rural areas; sustainable rural development also contributes to environmental sustainability, substantially contributing to restoration and sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity, as well as ensuring economic growth, with agriculture development identified as the most effective. In fact, although agriculture can be the lead sector for overall growth in the agriculture-based countries, it has been vastly underused for development.    Furthermore, the Technical Committees discussed FAO's Common Principles for Sustainable Food and Agriculture as a basis for the policy dialogue and governance arrangements needed to identify sustainable development pathways across the SDGs and requested the Secretariat to develop this principles into comprehensive pathways to engage the agricultural sectors in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda to be presented to the next committees sessions(2018).

		"q2_2": "- In December 2015, in order to enhance programme delivery FAO established full time dedicated Strategic Programme leaders and teams to support design, planning, implementation and monitoring of the programmes, which have a clear set of time-bound results to be delivered by FAO, mainly at country level. These are (i) hunger eradication, food security and nutrition; ii) sustainable agriculture; iii) rural poverty reduction; iv) food systems; v) resilience-building. This approach helps FAO to make maximum use of its comparative advantages and linking its normative work at global level and technical cooperation work at regional and country level. It facilitates constant two-way feedback, building on priority needs of countries and regions, especially those that concern cross-border issues and require interdisciplinary work. At the centre of the priorities lies the overarching vision of eradicating poverty and hunger, assisting countries in prioritizing the needs and fulfilling  of rural populations' rights, still accounting for over the 75% of the poorest on the planet, and often the ones left behind. The 5 Strategic Programmes translate the above in concrete programmes and projects in the field, providing a wide range of services, capacities, advise, technical support delivered in collaboration with the UN and other stakehoders. The strategic review of FAO Objectives and programmes benefited from the integrated vision and challenges posed by the 2030 Agenda, and SDGs were fully incorporated in the process. As reported above, the result-framework of FAO has been fully aligned with SDGs, its targets and indicators, used annually to analyse and evaluate results.   Specific mention is due to the dedicated resources devoted to assisting countries in developing capacity towards the complex   SDG monitoring system. In January 2017 a new Office of Chief Statistician was created, to better focus on the 21 SDG indicators for which FAO is custodian, and mandated to directly assist countries, mobilize technical and financial resources, and coordinate and support the work of regional bodies with evidence and reliable data, assist and coordinate with the UN Statistical Commissions and the UN Regional Economic Commissions, develop indicator standards and methodologies, monitoring the quality of statistical processes, build capacities in countries in generating, collecting and analysing data, and report annually on SDG progress.

		"q2_3": "The strategic thinking process undertaken for preparing the Medium Term Plan 2018-2021 provided a basis for re-focusing FAO Strategic Objectives on the commitments of the SDGs. Following an analysis of the full set of 230 indicators and 169 targets of the 17 SDGs, the Organization identified those for which it is best placed to support countries, often identifying partners and stakeholders complementing FAO's expertise and knowledge. The review considered the relationship of the SDG targets to the FAO results chain in three ways: the main challenges to the achievement of the five Strategic Objectives; the relevance of the SDG indicators to the results of the Organization's Strategic Programmes at country level, based on lessons learned in support to governments and stakeholders at field level; and the meaningfulness of SDG indicators for assessing progress in achieving FAO's SOs or Outcomes.

		"q3_1": "FAO has started collaborating with national governments on the alignment of SDGs with relevant regional development strategies and national sectoral strategies. In Africa, FAO advocated with countries for the inclusion of SDGs in the key regional strategies related to agriculture, such as CAADP/Malabo commitments, as well as their inclusion in respective national strategic and investment plans. At national level, FAO has been advocating for mainstreaming the SDGs in relevant sectoral national strategies, policies and development plans. For example, in Jordan FAO has been providing technical support on developing a national vision of agriculture in the context of the SDGs.   In Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines) the efforts focused on the preparation of national plans of action to localize SDGs both at national and provincional levels. In this context, a regional workshop was organized in 2017, aiming at promoting regular exchange mechanisms on best practices in SDG implementation through national plans of action.   FAO, being a custodian UN agency for 21 SDG indicators, has been providing enhanced assistance to countries in various sectors, related to data and statistical capacity development for SDGs monitoring, including by developing guidelines, delivering training programmes and organizing awareness raising workshops and seminars in the countries. For instance, in Africa, FAO working directly with national statistics offices, raised awareness and developed capacities of 24 countries and regional institutions on statistical tools for estimating SDG-2 indicators and their relevance for food security policies. In Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) national workshops were organized to develop capacities on SDG  indicators.  In the Near East, data and capacity building support was recently provided to Sudan, Jordan and Lebanon, focusing in particular on modernizing the national agricultural statistics systems. In Asia, a regional advocacy event and workshop was organized in September 2017, bringing together senior experts from national planning and statistical offices of 21 countries to develop capacity on monitoring and methodologies related to SDG-2.  FAO has been using actively the multi-stakeholder partnership platforms at regional and country level to support governments in the implementation of the SDGs. FAO engages with a variety of resource partners, such as Global Environmental Facility (GEF), Green Climate Fund (GFC), African Development Bank (AfDB), private sector and foundations.   In the Near East, FAO has been engaged in productive collaboration with the League of Arab States (LAS) on SDG-2, aiming at monitoring developments in food security and nutrition sectors in LAS countries and identifying countries for joint UN support. FAO also committed to supporting the proposed new coordination committee on SDG-2 within the League of Arab States.    In Asia, FAO supported national governments to adopt a whole-of-society approach, thereby involving stakeholders and civil society, but also media to out to society more broadly, and sharing lessons learned, best practices and experiences.  FAO has supported countries through regional SDG workshops in Africa, Europe and Central Asia, South Asia and North Africa to promote sustainable agriculture and food sectors in the on-going processes of nationalizing SDGs. In total, more than 70 countries have received support through these workshops—raising awareness, promoting dialogue and empowering countries to enhance the role of agricultural and food sectors in SDGs (and Paris Agreement) implementation. The meetings brought together representatives from agriculture, forestry, fisheries and other key sectors, including environment, trade, rural development and health, as well as engaging with civil society, private sector and academia to help build multi-stakeholder partnerships that are needed to achieve the SDGs. These regional workshops were complemented by country level support and has taken various forms according to national priorities (awareness raising, policy review and revision, capacity development, support to Voluntary National Reviews, etc.) and funding (TCPs, LoAs, National Consultants). Support focuses on integration and collaboration in the context of wider UN country support. In addition:  In 2017 national SDG implementation support was provided to around 20 countries in Africa (2 countries), Asia Pacific (3), Europe and Central Asia (7), Near East and North Africa (3) and Latin America and Caribbe (5). In addition, regional workshops were held and country support provided on SDG Indicators under FAO custodianship.  SDG nationalization processes provide an excellent window of opportunity to promote sustainable food and agriculture at highest political levels and to engage with different line ministries on changes required to more sustainable food ad agriculture. FAO's Programme on Sustainable Agriculture has strongly supported country engagement and has been the ‘operational arm' of SDG implementation in countries and regions. It has reached a large number of countries in 2017 and sees high up-scaling potential in 2018.   The five principles of sustainable food and agriculture (SFA) were used to promote a common vision and action points to address the SDGs. These principles include: improving efficiency in resource use, improved natural resource management, improved livelihoods and social equity, resilience of people, communities and ecosystems, and responsive governance mechanisms.  Examples of country level SDG support include:   In Rwanda, with support from European Union, FAO has assisted the Government in developing its fourth National Strategic Programmes for Agriculture Transformation, which has used key SDG  indicators to develop its theory of change and results framework. An Integrated approach to agriculture development is also being piloted at local level in Rulindo District to demonstrate the feasibility of an SDG approach on the ground.  In Morocco, FAO has been facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogue on SDG through the SFA principles, and has supported decentralised planning through landscape/territorial approach in the Souss-Massa Region.  In Bangladesh, FAO is supporting SDG action plan and related budgeting at the highest political level. It builds capacity of eight Line Ministries on SDG integration in operational planning and implementation. FAO supports the alignment of Country Investment Programmes with the SDGs, and is set to support the country in integrating the SDGs fully in the upcoming 8th Five Year Plan, the strategic national planning and budgeting tool.  In Kyrgyzstan, support is being provided to integrate the SDGs into their new multi-year programme on agriculture. The CPF of KYR is also being strongly aligned with the SDGs.   In Jordan, FAO has worked closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Planning Ministry in preparing the country's Voluntary National Review (VNR) of SDGs for the 2017 session of the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), highlighting the linkages between agriculture and food security.   Across all the regions, FAO has initiated the mainstreaming of the Agenda 2030 and the SDGs in its Country Programming Frameworks (CPFs), which are key guiding tools defining FAO's strategic priority areas of assistance with the national governments. The CPFs are currently being updated to reflect the wide range of activities being performed by country offices to support SDG implementation and reporting.  FAO has started collaborating with national governments on the alignment of SDGs with relevant regional development strategies and national sectoral strategies, policies and development plans.   Examples: In Africa, FAO advocated with countries for the inclusion of SDGs in the key regional strategies related to agriculture, such as CAADP/Malabo commitments, as well as their inclusion in respective national strategic and investment plans.  In Asia, the efforts were focused on the preparation of national plans of action to localize SDGs both at national and provincial levels (a workshop organized in 2017 to promote regular exchange on best practices in SDG implementation through national plans of action).

Courses are targeted to statistical experts across sectors, and are freely available upon registration. Other on line training/awareness raising courses are under discussion and may be available in 2018.     A number of capacity development interventions are jointly being designed between FAO and ITC-ILO to directly support Member States in the collection, analysis, interpretation, monitoring and reporting of the FAO SDG indicators.

FAO  hosts, is engaged in and/or convenes, over 30 multi-stakeholder partnerships that are contributing to specific thematic SDG areas and addressing the challenges of sustainable development.  The  Committee of World Food Security (CFS), hosted by FAO with IFAD and WFP, is known as the foremost inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for all stakeholders to work together to ensure food security and nutrition for all. In 2018, FAO also launched six multi-stakeholder partnership – called Global Knowledge Products –to strengthen support on specific  themes covered by SDG2, SDG6 , SDG13 and SDG 15.  These include sustainable agriculture, water, climate change and landscape management.    The strength of these multi stakeholder partnerships is that they reunite the knowledge and expertise of different stakeholders - public and private sectors, producers, research and academic institutions, NGO's social movements and community-based organizations.  To name a few, FAO is the secretariat and/or a partner of these MSP  which can be covers  SDGs themes as follows:    SDG1 = Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition; The Right to Food Forum; Poverty Alleviation and Sustainable Economic Growth in Africa  SDG2 = One Health Partnership; The World Banana Forum; Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock, Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicine, Global Knowledge Products on Agroecology, Biodiversity and Family farming;   SDG 13 : Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture;   SDG 6: Global Framework on Water Scarcity in Agriculture  SDG 12 : Save Food Initiative   SDG 15 : Global Soil Partnership; Forest- Farm Facility     Furthermore, the 13th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on  Biological Diversity requested FAO to act as Biodiversity Mainstreaming Platform to facilitate the integration in a structured and coherent manner of actions for the conservation, sustainable use, management and restoration of biological diversity across agricultural sectors at national, regional and international levels.

		"q5": "FAO is fully committed to delivering the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Agenda in collaboration with the rest of the UN system. The Organization's partners with other UN agencies, funds and programmes in the development of statistical methods and the provision of support at country level for monitoring the SDGS.   Through its continued engagement in the UNDG Sustainable Development Working Group, FAO contributed to the consolidation of MAPS, UNDAG revised guidelines and the guidelines for monitoring SDGs at country level, all actively promoted across FAO country and regional offices. Through an FAO survey, countries reported increased collaboration with the UN system, and increased demands for support in integrating SDGs in country planning and on establishing monitoring systems for SDGs.  Of particular relevance for FAO is the Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS) approach and guidance to UN Country Teams. The MAPS are complementary to the UNDAFs and recognize the need for specialized agencies' expertise on norms, policy, standards and monitoring of progress. However, in spite of its strong policy and normative expertise, FAO was not always invited to MAPS mission being conducted in many countries. The same was reported by other specialized agencies, and this should be corrected in the future.   FAO is also placing particular emphasis on further developing collaboration among the Rome-based agencies. During 2016, the Organization developed with IFAD and WFP a common vision and guiding principles for collaboration among the UN Rome-based Agencies on delivering the 2030 Agenda, which was endorsed by the FAO Council in December 2016 as a useful reference for future joint activities.  Building on its policy, normative and standard-setting expertise, FAO works in close collaboration with UN partners, other sub-regional, regional and international organizations, to provide integrated policy advice and capacity development to the member countries in support of the 2030 Agenda implementation across all the regions. FAO collaborates with the Secretariats of the three Rio Conventions and has and active present during their respective Conference of the Parties as well as through their scientifically advisory bodies.  FAO has published its flagship publication The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017 to report on indicators for targets 2.1 and 2.2 in hat monitors two SDG indicators in partnership with IFAD, WFP and for the first time UNICEF and WHO to include a broader focus on nutrition. Other thematic flagship publications are being aligned to SDGs and will be made available to the decision makers and other stakeholders as part of the follow-up and review process for the 2030 Agenda.  FAO collaborates with WHO and OIE under a tripartite to promote cross-sectoral collaboration and increase convergence towards a One Health approach to address risks from zoonoses and other public health threats existing and emerging at the human-animal-ecosystems interface. FAO is also part of the Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance.  In 2017 FAO signed a partnership with the International Trade Centre (ITC) to support improvement of the incomes, livelihoods, sustainability, resilience and nutritional status of small and medium rural agricultural producers by expanding access to productive resources, markets, technology, trade, finance and investment.  FAO is part and actively engages in all the following coordination mechanisms: CEB (and its HLCP and HLCM), UNDG (FAO is part of the core group of the revamped UNSDG), EC-ESA Plus, RCMs, UN-Energy, UN-Water, UN-Ocean, IAEG, IATT.   At regional level:  FAO regional offices have been actively engaged in coordination and collaboration with UN Regional Economic Commissions, thereby leveraging existing mechanisms such as Regional Coordination Mechanisms and other partnership modalities. FAO is also active in regional UNDG coordination, taking part to thematic groups and task force. Increased regional UNDG coordination was instrumental to advance regional discussions in SF forums organized by UNECs.  In the Near East, FAO's Regional Office has initiated the establishment and is currently co-leading the Food Security and Nutrition Working Group on SDG-2, working in partnership with WFP, UNICEF, WHO  and the ESCWA. This regional-level coordination resulted in a result-oriented partnership at the country level.  In many African countries these efforts were focused on bringing together the three Rome-based agencies (FAO, WFP and IFAD) in supporting countries to deliver on SDG-2 and the Zero Hunger initiative.   In Latin America, FAO has ongoing joint programmes with other UN Agencies in several countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Colombia), entirely focused on the SDGs.   In Asia, the emphasis is put on collaboration with various regional economic organizations (ASEAN, SAARC), financial institutions (World bank, Asian Development Bank) and specialized international and national research institutions, including CGIAR Centers.     FAO has been an active member of UN-Water and is the lead agency in it in food and agriculture related issues. This includes being a part of the UN-Water team that works on SDG 6 and the linkages between water and other SDGs; an implementing partner in the integrated monitoring initiative for SDG6, entitled GEMI; and chair of the UN-Water group on water scarcity. FAO, in addition, has launched a partnership initiative (WASAG) dealing with water scarcity, which has a number of UN partners. Deputy Director of FAO Land and Water Division will take over the function of UN-Water Vice Chair in August 2018 for a period of two years.      The Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6, called GEMI, was established in 2014 as an inter-agency initiative composed of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment), the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), UNICEF, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). GEMI's focus is to integrate and expand existing monitoring efforts on wastewater treatment (SDG indicator 6.3.1) and water quality (6.3.2), water use (6.4.1) and scarcity (6.4.2), integrated water resources management (6.5.1) including transboundary cooperation (6.5.2) and water-related ecosystems (6.6.1). The first phase of GEMI implementation (2015–2018) focuses on the development of monitoring methodologies and other support tools (including pilot testing), a global rollout of SDG 6 monitoring and associated capacity building efforts, as well as the establishment of a global baseline for SDG targets 6.3 to 6.6. It is worth noting that in spite of existing and expected difficulties, the collaboration and coordination among agencies in the implementation of the Initiative under the umbrella of UN-Water is proving to be quite effective and is appreciated by member states. A suggestion for improvement would be to establish regional correspondents for UN-Water, who could be based at the UN Coordinator offices, and who could support and follow more closely the implementation of the joint initiatives.     The Global Framework on Water Scarcity in Agriculture under a changing climate (WASAG)  was launched by the Director General of FAO at the UNFCCC COP 22 in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2016 and became a Partnership in April 2017 with a membership which has grown to 50 partners including UN agencies such IFAD, UNCCD, UNEP, UNESCO and WMO, together with several other partners including governments, research institutions, financial institutions and advocacy groups.

FAO members adopted the Strategy for Partnerships with Civil Society Organizations  and the Strategy for Partnerships with Private Sector to strengthen corporate and country-focused engagements with private sector, business enterprises, civil society and NGOs, farmer organizations especially women groups, academia, and parliamentarians.  The six main areas of collaboration are: Field programme; Knowledge sharing and capacity development; Policy dialogue; Joint use of resources; Normative activities; and Advocacy and communication and South–South Cooperation.  Since 2013, FAO has forged partnerships with over 120 non-state actors including from  Academia, CSOs and Private Sector entities in support of its Strategic Programmes and specific SDGs. At the global level, FAO involves networks and organizations with the broadest possible representation vis-à-vis their constituency and region. At national level, FAO works through the framework of the Country Programme Framework (CPF) and assists governments in identifying key local CSOs that can contribute to priorities set out in the CPF.  See http://www.fao.org/partnerships/en/.    Over 2 000 delegates from civil society, private sector and academia have attended the annual CFS and some 1 000 non-state actor delegations participated in the International Conference of Nutrition (ICN-2) in 2014, International Symposia on Agroecology (2014), Biotechnologies (2016), and Nutrition (2016). The space for dialogue and interaction with the stakeholder groups was widely acknowledged and provided strong consensus in the areas to promote achieving the Zero Hunger goal.    FAO has been using actively the multi-stakeholder partnership platforms at regional and country level to support governments in the implementation of the SDGs. FAO engages with a variety of resource partners, such as Global Environmental Facility (GEF), Green Climate Fund (GFC), regional development banks and regional economic integration organizations, private sector and foundations, research institutions.

Therefore providing a detailed account of the events constitutes a difficult task and only some of the events that featured a higher profile.   In December 2016, FAO organized the High-level Event \"Step It Up Together with Rural Women to End Hunger and Poverty\" and International Symposium on Sustainable Food Systems for Healthy Diets and Improved Nutrition.   During the 40th Session of the FAO Conference, brought together a panel of representatives from government, civil society and the private sector to share experiences and highlight examples of FAO's work in gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.  In 2017 FAO held a Global Symposium on Soil Organic Carbon     Scheduled events  International Conference. Halting Deforestation and Increasing Forest Area – from Aspiration to Action (February 2018). The main objective of the conference is to make recommendations, through UNFF13, to the High Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development on actions to be undertaken globally and by countries to help achieve the SDG and GFG targets of halting deforestation and increasing forest cover.  International Symposium on Agroecology: Scaling Up agroecology to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (April 2018)  Global Symposium on Soil Pollution (May 2018)  High Level Event on Mainstreaming Biodiversity across sectors. (June 2018)      FAO has organized or contributed to the organization of a number of thematic events, focusing specifically on the SDG-2 and the Zero Hunger Challenge, both at national and regional levels.   At regional level, for instance, FAO contributed to the High-Level Africa Round Table on SDGs held in Accra in December 2017, which emphasized the urgency of mobilizing support and accelerating implementation of the SDGs in Africa. FAO specifically contributed to panel discussion on partnerships.   In Asia, FAO – working in close cooperation with UNESCAP – contributes regularly to the organization of an annual Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development in Bangkok. In 2017, FAO contribution focused on the organization of thematic roundtables on SDGs 1, 2 and 5 as a part of preparatory work for the High-Level Political Forum in New York in July 2017.  The Asia Pacific Regional Symposium on \"Sustainable Food Systems and Healthy Diets for Improving Nutrition\" co-organized by FAO, WHO, WFP, UNICEF and World Bank in November 2017 in Bangkok, built common understanding with member nations and development partners about the severe burden of malnutrition and the rapidly changing food systems and food environments in the Asia-Pacific Region, and developed of a toolbox of options to promote access to nutritious, safer and affordable diets.  In Europe, FAO was a keynote speaker at the regional workshop on mobilizing action of countries on the role of sustainable food and agriculture to 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, organized in Belarus in June 2017. The event resulted in identifying ways and actions to promote broad ownership through cross-sectoral dialogue, more coordinated planning, partnerships with private sector and civil society.   The upcoming FAO Regional Conferences cycle (February-May 2018) would be another excellent opportunity for FAO to place the SDG-2 high in the political agenda of the national governments, regional organizations and civil society representatives participating in these forums. For instance, the relevant ministerial roundtables of these regional conferences aim at sharpening the focus on the SDG-2, sustainable agriculture and food systems. Special side-event and panel discussions on the Zero Hunger Challenge will be organized at each of five FAO Regional Conference.    ",

ICAO's No Country Left Behind (NCLB) Initiative has the objective to assist all States in complying with the ICAO SARPs, and the implementation of its 2017-2019 Business Plan and Strategic Objectives – which are closely intertwined with 15 of the 17 SDGs.     More specifically through the NCLB Initiative ICAO aims at:   •\tAdvocating the benefits of aviation for States at high levels of government. One of the priorities of the NCLB is to garner the political will necessary to support aviation improvements. The ICAO World Aviation Forum (IWAF) which has been successfully convened three times, is an example of ICAO's efforts to bring together high-level participants from States, the aviation community and financial institutions, and to demonstrate how the implementation of aviation global standards and policies will enhance a safe, secure, efficient, economically viable and environmentally sound air transport system thereby contributing to achieving the UN SDGs.   •	Developing tools and services that assist States in their implementation efforts. ICAO has been developing tools and services (for example, ICAO eTools1, ICAO Data+2, iSTARS3, iMPLEMENT4, Carbon Calculator, EBT5, and IFSET6 and CERT) to assist States in identifying their particular needs and deficiencies, implementing aviation-related projects and programmes, mapping solutions, developing business cases, showcasing the socio-economic benefits of aviation and the opportunities to reduce its impact on the environment, etc.  •	Monitoring the global compliance of SARPs. ICAO has instituted a mandatory audit/continuous monitoring programme to monitor States' level of meeting its oversight obligations. These audit activities in both aviation safety and security area lead to not only identify significant safety/security concerns at State level but also recognize States that make significant progress in resolving their safety oversight deficiencies and improving the effective implementation (EI) of SARPs.  •	Facilitating and implementing capacity-building initiatives. The NCLB initiative signals ICAO's renewed emphasis on support to States for implementation and development. ICAO is working to provide more direct assistance and capacity-building activities in order to improve effective implementation of SARPs by States. In the area of environmental protection, ICAO has produced a series of guidance documents aimed at facilitating the identification and implementation of low emissions aviation measures, in synergy with existing States' policy priorities.  •	Prioritizing assistance needs and assessing risks. State oversight capabilities are always linked with the demands placed upon it by the unique characteristics of its aviation sector activity. Therefore, while prioritization is made according to the global targets established by the Global Aviation Plans, the targets and goals should be customized for each State, taking into account each State's aviation profile. ICAO then is able to co-ordinate with States through the provision of technical assistance, which is funded by the Regular Budget or voluntary contributions.  ",

ICAO is working with Member States, aviation industry partners and professional associations, academia, and the UN to facilitate equal STEM education access to girls and boys as well as career development opportunities for women working in aviation through professional assignments at ICAO. These principles are also embedded in the Next Generation of Aviation Professionals (NGAP) Programme. ICAO also hosts networking and advocacy events aimed at raising awareness for gender in aviation and the advancement of women within the global aviation community.   -	ICAO Global Aviation Security Plan (GASeP) In line with ICAO's Aviation Security and Facilitation Strategic Objective - the GASeP presents an ambitious goal-based plan that commits ICAO, States and industry collectively to significantly improve aviation security by 2030, consistent with the direction provided by ICAO's Assembly and in support of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. The GASeP was approved for immediate implementation and adopted as a \"living document\". It will remain so as ICAO continues to welcome State feedback to enable ICAO to assess any further improvements that can be made to the Plan. Moreover, to ensure the GASeP incorporates lessons learned from recent regional conferences, a global High-level Conference on Aviation Security will take place in 2018.  ",

That same year ICAO invited UNDESA, UN-OHRLLS, the WBG, and ATAG to join the APSD Initiative. As such this partnership now includes representation from the UN system, international and regional organizations, financial institutions and the private sector. It advocates the aviation benefits for sustainable development and sensitizes high level government decision makers beyond the air transport sector to promote the benefits of mobilizing resources for and investing in sustainable aviation.    -	To advocate action towards achieving the 2030 Agenda with civil aviation as its enabler, the APSD partners have been actively engaging in an array of events in 2017 which target the achievement of the UN SDGs. In 2018, SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12 and 15 featuring, among others \"city\", \"energy\" and \"ecosystems\", will be the topics of the thematic review at the July UN High-Level Political Forum. In addition, Member States will be presenting voluntary national reviews, which might touch upon above-mentioned SDGs and also cover transport and aviation related issues.     -	Throughout 2018, the APSD will showcase contributions of sustainable civil aviation towards these SDGs. Its members will jointly illustrate from their distinct perspectives how civil aviation is shaping the sustainable mobility agenda, impacting urban development, supporting regional socio-economic prosperity and contributing towards an environmentally responsible transportation. This will happen through a series of events that are planned to be embedded in selected 2018 high-level conferences. A kick-off APSD event took place in January during the \"2018 Transforming Transportation Conference\" which was organized by the World Bank and EMBARQ, the sustainable mobility initiative of the World Resources Institute (WRI) Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.    Sustainable Mobility for All (SuM4All) in support of the SDGs:     -	At the 2016 Climate Action Summit - the World Bank Group president called for action to bring greater coherence and accelerate efforts to unify and transform the transport sector. He proposed to develop, with interested transport stakeholders, a new and strategic global initiative that will support the implementation of the SDGs and transform the sector. This announcement was greeted by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ba Ki-moon. This Call for Action led to the creation of the Sustainable Mobility for All (SuM4All) Initiative that aimed to create a neutral platform where transport stakeholders could discuss cross-cutting issues, across all modes of transportation.    -	Pursuing its efforts to advocate sustainable aviation in support of the SDGs, ICAO joined forces in 2017 with other transport stakeholders, active in the SuM4All Initiative to assess the state of global transport across all modes, the result of which was published in the first ever Global Mobility Report (GMR). The GMR is built around three components: (i) four global objectives that define "sustainable mobility "; (ii) quantitative and qualitative targets for those objectives, drawn from international agreements; and (iii) indicators to track country-level progress towards those objectives. It covers all modes of transport, including road, air, waterborne and rail. The GMR will inform a global roadmap of actions towards sustainable mobility to be developed in 2018.    -	In January 2018, the initiative was formally established during the 4th Transport Consortium Meeting in Washington DC, with a charter, a workplan and an interim governance arrangement. ICAO is member of both the consortium and interim steering committee. The SuM4All includes over 50 leading organizations and agencies, representing UN agencies (including ICAO), private sector, development banks, foundations, donors, inter-governmental organizations, and international associations agreed to work together under one umbrella, with a commitment to support an equitable, efficient, safe and green mobility.     -	The SuM4All is a stellar platform to advocate the benefits of aviation as an enabler of socio-economic advances allowing cross-fertilization between economies and strengthening connectivity among people.

In 2017 UNDESA, UN-OHRLLS, WBG and ATAG joined the initiative and jointly with ICAO sensitized high level government officials about the importance to include aviation into national development plans, advocated its enabling role in support of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and promoted the benefits of mobilizing resources for and investing in sustainable aviation. Specific APSD events were organized during the:     -	2017 Spring Meeting of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Transport (GPST):   An APSD side event was organized and proved to be effective to raise awareness about aviation benefits and to prioritize the sector in global development frameworks that in turn allocate resources.   -	2017 UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF): The APSD organized a High-Level Briefing on Aviation Contributions to Sustainable Development in Countries in Special Situations (see para 4 above).   -	ATAG Summit during which the APSD Workshop provided participants with a clear understanding of the inter- linkages between the different UN frameworks (e.g. the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Vienna Programme of Action and the Samoa Pathway) and how these benefit sustainable aviation in  SIDS and LLDCs. In addition, State representatives had the opportunity to talk with industries and donors about the status of air transport in their respective countries.    •	Sustainable Mobility for All (Sum4All) Initiative was established in January 2017 with the aim to create a neutral platform where transport stakeholders could discuss cross-cutting issues, across all modes of transportation. The SuM4All partners are committed to speak with one global voice and act collectively to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) and transform the transport sector. To date, the Sum4All Initiative includes 48 transport agencies and organizations representing a range of stakeholders that includes UN agencies, private sector, development banks, foundations, donors, inter-governmental organizations, and international associations. ICAO has a seat on the SuM4All Steering Committee which as the governance body sets out the vision and direction of Initiative. On 19 October 2017, the Sustainable Mobility for All (SuM4All) Initiative launched its Global Mobility Report (GMR) which shapes a commonly agreed vision for sustainable mobility, supported by a global tracking framework and a global program of actions. ICAO has been successful in having all its inputs incorporated into the 4 SuM4All Streams of work and indicators (Safety, Universal Access Efficiency and Green Mobility). The GMR was featured in more than 40 prime outlets and reached more than 3 million people.     •	ICAO Cooperation with the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): On SDG 13 (Climate Change), in accordance with ICAO Assembly Resolution A39-2 on climate change, ICAO \"exercises continuous leadership on environmental issues relating to international aviation, including greenhouse gas emissions\". The Resolution also requests ICAO to \"continue to cooperate with organizations involved in policy-making in this field, notably with the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC\". ICAO maintains a close relationship with the UNFCCC, by regularly providing information and perspectives on issues related to international aviation and on those matters considered by the various UNFCCC deliberative bodies that may have an impact on the aviation sector. This is particularly relevant following the Paris Agreement reached during the UNFCCC 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21), held in Paris in December 2015, and ICAO is now driving the actions needed from international aviation to help complement the ambitious objectives set out in the Paris Agreement.    •	ICAO Environmental Partnerships on Capacity Building and Assistance to States: The ICAO partnership with the European Union launched in 2013 enabled all 14 selected States in Africa and the Caribbean to develop and submit to ICAO their action plans to reduce aviation CO2 emissions, and install a tailor-made Aviation Environmental System (AES) that supports robust monitoring, verification and reporting of environmental data. The ICAO-EU project is also facilitating the implementation of CO2 mitigation measures, such as operational improvements, use of renewable energy for aircraft at airport gates, and feasibility studies on the use of sustainable aviation fuels. Under the project, and in cooperation with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), dedicated training material, consisting of an e-learning course and e-books on State Action Plans and mitigation measures, has been developed. The ICAO partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Global Environmental Facility (GEF) also allowed for the installation of solar panels at the airport gate at an international airport in Jamaica, creating the opportunity for other Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to replicate this project and multiply the associated environmental benefits. Moreover, as part of this project, guidance materials on financing, renewable energy, sustainable aviation fuels and regulatory and organizational measures have been developed, and made available on the project website. Pursuant to ICAO Assembly Resolution A39-3 on the historic agreement of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a series of preparatory activities for the implementation of CORSIA were undertaken, including a partnership between ICAO and the Government of Germany to undertake a pilot project for the small-scale implementation of the CORSIA Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) System, to ensure its feasibility and practicality, in cooperation with seven selected ICAO Member States and their airlines.

		"q7": "•\tThe ICAO World Aviation Forum (IWAF) is organized yearly to explore the benefits of the aviation sector to the social, economic development and prosperity of Member States and to discuss, identify needs, and facilitate the funding and financing required to accelerate the implementation of international civil aviation global standards and policies, as well as global plans for aviation, in support of the ICAO No Country Left Behind (NCLB) initiative and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its participants include high-level government officials responsible for aviation, transport and infrastructure, finance, economy, and tourism; and key industry and financial partners.     The participants of each IWAF agreed on the need to establish strong, long-term partnerships with the industry and financial institutions and on the importance of incorporating the aviation sector into the integrated transport system and of prioritizing aviation in development plans; actions that are supported by the ICAO's No Country Left Behind initiative which ultimately contribute to achievement of the 2030 Agenda.    •	The 2016 IWAF focused on the special needs and structural characteristics of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), as well as Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). These States were recognized in the coordination, prioritization, facilitation and implementation of assistance programmes through the ICAO Aviation Partnerships for Sustainable Development. During the IWAF particular attention was placed on the work of the United Nations Secretary-General's High-Level Advisory Group on Sustainable Transport, highlighting the need, inter alia, to: a) integrate all sustainable transport planning efforts with a balanced development of transport modes; b) create supportive institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks at the national level; and c) foster an informed, engaged public as a crucial partner in advancing a sustainable transport solution.     •	The 2017 IWAF in 2017 adopted the new Declaration and Framework for a Plan of Action for Development of Aviation Infrastructure in Africa within the framework of the Lomé Plan of Action on Tourism (2017 – 2019) of the African Union. It called on the actions by African States, African Regional Economic Communities as well as international assistance partners etc. in support of the development of quality aviation infrastructure in Africa in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063. The commitment herewith made by African States and Regional Economic Communities was, inter alia, to ensure the inclusion of better-defined aviation projects in the Program for Infrastructure Development for Africa (PIDA). The participants also agreed to continue to work together to showcase the benefits of aviation and obtain related buy-ins from relevant stakeholders in achieving the objective of expanding and modernizing aviation infrastructure. The participants remained concerned on the limited volume of international public finance and assistance for development (for example, official development assistance and South-South cooperation), which is currently available for aviation infrastructure projects despite aviation's cross-cutting nature and multiple links to other economic sectors. International public finance and assistance can be used to unlock additional finance through blended or pooled financing and risk mitigation for infrastructure. In addition, it can catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and private.    •	The 2018 IWAF will take place in September in Brazil.    ICAO also organized other seminars and events in the area of :  -	Environmental Protection: In the spring and summer of 2017, ICAO organized a series of regional seminars to support its Member States with the development of their Action Plans on CO2 emissions reduction activities from international aviation and to increase States' awareness on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. Dissemination workshops are planned in 2018, as part of the ICAO-UNDP-GEF assistance project to support SIDS and developing States implement low emissions aviation measures.  -	Security and Facilitation: ICAO held its first annual Global Aviation Security Symposium (AVSEC2017) in September 2017 at the ICAO Headquarters in Montréal, Canada, which was attended by 497 participants from 87 Members States and 42 International organizations and industry associations. The three-day Symposium served as a platform to promote the work of ICAO, its Member States and stakeholders in the area of aviation security. This Symposium strategically enhanced international cooperation and collaboration to address the threat posed by terrorists targeting civil aviation by reinforcing, strengthening and promoting the international framework of aviation security. The Second annual Global Aviation Security Symposium (AVSEC2018) will be held in November 2018.    Two ICAO TRIP Workshops on Border Control Management (BCM) in the Caribbean Regions were organized as well. This created a working environment for States representative to directly engage with international experts on issues and best practices related to BCM. The main gap identified relates to the need for further information on the national public key infrastructure (PKI). In terms of lessons learned, having all the participants and experts at one venue enables strengthening the dialogue and working relationships.     In order to continue to raise awareness of stakeholders on the holistic traveller identification management concept, four ICAO Traveller Identification Programme (TRIP) events have been organized in 2017, namely three regional seminars and the Thirteenth TRIP Symposium and Exhibition which was held at ICAO Headquarters. These events are conducted with the active participation of other international organizations involved in the TRIP implementation, experts from the ICAO Working Groups and from the industry. These events are arranged to coincide back-to-back with workshops. They offer the opportunity to promote best practices for managing secure passport issuance and border control systems. The regional seminars also served to highlight the relevance of the ICAO TRIP Strategy in the context of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the shared efforts to confront international movements of terrorists, cross border crime and other threats to civil society and international aviation.    Both seminars aimed to disseminate information to States on the ICAO TRIP Strategy, identifying the current challenges and assisting them to implement the related-provisions. As was done in previous years, the plan for the coming years is to organize one symposium and two regional seminars per year. The role of the ICAO TRIP Symposium and Seminars in providing a global/regional forum for the exchange of information on all aspects of the ICAO TRIP Strategy is recognized as the best way to raise awareness on the holistic traveller identification management concept.    -	Safety: ICAO hosted a global air navigation industry symposium and a safety and air navigation implementation symposium aiming to bring experts form States and industry to align projects and views regarding current and future technologies and how they can help to improve the aviation system and improve national economies. The exposure of experts from States to new concepts and emerging technologies helps the definition of national priorities and the effective use of restricted budgets. During the event, more than 600 participants had the opportunity to see and debate on the current and future aviation activities that will shape the future of aviation to better support the development of economies and increase safety, efficiency and resilience of air transportation. The implementation of the mentioned technologies and concepts were addressed and guidance was provided to support cost effective implementation of operational improvements.    -	Gender: ICAO will host the first ever Gender and aviation global summit in South Africa in August 2018. This will be an opportunity to take stock, share experiences, distil lessons learned and have States and stakeholders agree on a call to action to narrow the gender divide in the aviation sector.

The IMF has launched a number of initiatives to enhance its support for its member countries in crucial ways as they pursue the SDGs. Specifically, the IMF:  •\thas expanded financial support for low-income developing countries, including: (i) a 50 percent increase in access norms and limits for all IMF concessional financing; (ii) zero percent interest rate on a permanent basis for IMF lending under the Rapid Credit Facility , (ii) an increase in access limits under the emergency financing instruments for countries hit by large natural disasters; and (iv) an extension of the zero percent interest rate to all other IMF concessional loans until at least end-2018. A comprehensive review of IMF concessional facilities is underway and expected to be completed this year;   •	is scaling up support for developing countries to boost domestic revenue mobilization, including by collaborating with other international organizations through the new Platform for Collaboration on Tax . The IMF provides technical assistance on tax policy and administration to over 100 countries every year and is scaling up its support for developing countries, including, where needed, the coverage of international tax issues;  •	is providing support—through its Infrastructure Policy Support Initiative—to member countries seeking to increase public investment in infrastructure. The initiative seeks to deepen the IMF's macroeconomic policy advice and capacity building work to help countries tackle large infrastructure gaps without endangering public debt sustainability. Several such pilot programs are underway. Moreover, the IMF's new debt limits policy adds flexibility to manage financing needs to support growth and investment while maintaining prudent debt levels. The IMF is also reforming the debt sustainability framework for low-income developing countries to better guide countries' borrowing decisions and maintain public debt on a sustainable path;  •	is bolstering its support to fragile and conflict states to address their specific challenges and wide and persistent capacity building needs, including through the new Capacity Building Framework , which seeks to support institution building goals, strengthen outcome monitoring, and enhance coordination with other partners;  •	is deepening and operationalizing its work on inequality and gender through a pilot approach. Under the initiative, inequality and gender related issues have been analyzed in more than 60 case studies and about 30 additional cases are in the pipeline.   •	is promoting deeper, more inclusive and more stable financial systems, through policy advice and TA. For example, the Financial Sector Stability Fund supports the delivery and follow-up TA and training through Financial Sector Stability Reviews (FSSRs), and developing balance sheet data and financial soundness indicators.   •	has stepped up support to countries vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change and is paying increasing attention to adaptation issues. In this regard, the IMF and WB have launched a joint Climate Change Policy Assessment (CCPA) providing country-specific frameworks assessing preparedness to climate change, climate mitigation and adaptation plans, and risk management strategies, with initial pilots including Seychelles and St. Lucia. Other country consultations examined carbon mitigation policies (Jamaica, Seychelles) and reforming energy policies (Sri Lanka, Vietnam).  ",

The IMF's Statistics Department has a strong track record in providing extensive and well-targeted capacity development (CD) to help countries enhance their statistical capacities in the area of macroeconomic and financial statistics. This work, which currently accounts for more than half of the department's output and makes the IMF one of the top five providers of statistics CD, has been buttressed by the IMF's standard-setting role across several statistical topical areas.    With more challenging international environment emanating from the need to monitor the implementation of the SDGs and to help improve countries' economic policy-making, the IMF has recalibrated its statistics CD strategy. In addition to CD being provided through its own resources, the IMF's Regional Technical Assistance Centers, and technical assistance projects funded by bilateral partners, the IMF has recently also set up two multi-partner trust funds to provide technical assistance and training to low- and lower middle-income countries world-wide to respond to these new challenges. These are:    · the Financial Sector Stability Fund, which under its statistics module helps countries (i) to compile and disseminate FSIs for use in financial sector analysis, policy formulation, and SDG monitoring; and (ii) implement the balance sheet approach to help identify economic risks and vulnerabilities countries are facing; and    · the Data for Decisions (D4D) Fund, which will have four modules with a strong emphasis on operational data to provide    more and better data to policy makers for evidence-based decision-making. Work under the four modules will also be conducive to SDG monitoring, either directly benefiting the four SDG indicators for which the IMF was chosen as custodian agency (see above) or indirectly by enhancing the quality of key macroeconomic datasets that are linked to many of the 17 SDGs (especially the measurement of GDP). In addition, one module aims to roll out a new online learning curriculum providing training in eight fundamental macroeconomic statistical areas, which will be instrumental in developing compilers' expertise, with expected positive externalities to other statistical areas (e.g., social and environmental statistics). Finally, one module will offer advice to countries' national statistical systems to standardize, streamline, and automate their statistical infrastructure, thereby enabling countries to better respond to the more challenging data environment.",

For example, increasing demand for labour in cities creates opportunities for poor rural people.  	Enhancing rural roads, electrification, ICTs, water and energy, as well as ensuring functional markets for land, labour and finance are all key elements for building an enabling environment for inclusive rural investments.  	Rural people must have the opportunity to participate in the design of policies; this means building the capacity of policy-makers to include these groups in consultation as well as building the capacity of rural people to contribute meaningfully to debates, including through different forms of social organization.  	Education, skills development and access to finance emerge as central elements of any strategy to enable poor rural people to improve their lives  	Supporting smallholders is a key dimension of any viable food security policy. Equally, creating opportunities for smallholders to enter other sectors and take advantage of emerging opportunities in dynamic rural non-farm and urban sectors should also be prioritized.  	Encouraging agglomeration, through functioning land markets and inclusive institutions will be needed to enable smallholders and financial service providers to overcome high transaction costs associated with the small-scale nature of many farming operations.    	In addition to knowledge sharing events too numerous to list, IFAD has organized global policy engagement forums at its HQ over the past 12 months on the following topics:  	Youth employment  	Climate adaptation for smallholders farmers  	The outlook on hunger  	Migration  ",

The SUN Movement is following a multi-sectoral, multi-stakeholder approach, with governments of 60 SUN countries and 3 States of India in the lead.     The Movement's vision is to, by 2030, ensure a world free from malnutrition in all its forms. Led by governments and supported by organisations and individuals – collective action will ensure every child, adolescent, mother and family can realise their right to food and nutrition, reach their full potential and shape sustainable and prosperous societies.     The SUN Movement is driven by a dedicated set of change agents. Member countries, led by governments, are the core of the SUN Movement, leading national efforts with a wealth of experience, insight and capacity. All the stakeholders in the Movement are changing their behaviours and committing to achieving common nutrition results behind government led plans:   •\tAt the global level, civil society, donors, businesses and UN agencies are organised into Networks. Each of the Networks has a global Steering Committee and a Secretariat which work to support the establishment and functioning of Networks at country level. They provide support and technical assistance, ensure timely exchange of information, and monitor and evaluate achievements  •	The SUN Movement Coordinator leads and strengthens collaboration between stakeholders and advocates for improving nutrition at country, regional and global levels   •	The SUN Movement Secretariat (SMS), provides support to its members' work and facilitates Movement-wide sharing and learning opportunities. The SMS enables access to technical assistance and support aligned with the SUN Movement's principles and the SDG's   •	The SUN Movement Executive Committee, oversees and supports the implementation of the SUN Movement Strategy and Roadmap and strengthens accountability within the Movement   •	The SUN Movement's Lead Group, consists of prominent leaders and change makers who have pledged to position nutrition at the highest levels and provide the inspiration, action and direction on a global scale. They are figureheads for nutrition and carry out strategic advocacy to ensure it grows in recognition as a maker and marker of sustainable development    SUN member countries and their supporters are working towards the World Health Assembly targets on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition by 2025, in addition to relevant targets for preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases.    The SUN Movement Strategy and Roadmap (2016-2020), endorsed by the SUN Lead Group in 2016, has helped illuminate the importance of nutrition as a universal agenda – and one which is integral to achieving the promise of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nutrition is a maker and marker of development. The SUN Movement strategy is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs are incorporated in the Movement's theory of change, and the concept of ‘leaving no one behind' is reflected in the Movement's strategy. In the spirit of the 2030 Agenda, the focus of the Movement was broadened from reducing stunting to ending all forms of malnutrition.

They do this by regularly and transparently tracking nutrition budget allocations against multi-sectoral nutrition plans. By 2017, 47 countries conducted an analysis of their government budgets, with 22 countries having done it for the second time. These efforts show that it is feasible to conduct a budget analysis but also that this process needs to be sustained and improved. The Movement has brought together SUN member countries in 2015, 2016 and 2017 to undertake budget analysis exercises to ensure more and better spending across ministries so as to tackle the underlying causes of malnutrition.

A strategic plan for UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda should reduce fragmentation, strengthen coherence and coordination and promote synergy of UN system entities, both at global but particularly also at country level.   The strategy must emphasize country ownership and leadership in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals, and the UN System role in aligning behind this approach and supporting policy coherence. Locally-owned and people-centered strategies are essential.   As the SDGs call for the breaking down of silos, it is essential that UN agencies align behind national development plans and support mutli-sectoral and multi-stakeholder collaboration. The UN is in a unique position to focus further on national capacity building to ensure there are the right technical and functional capacities for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at country level.  Promote – from the onset – partnering among multiple actors, beyond Government and UN.   The UN is also in unique position to encourage investment from the domestic budget in addressing sustainable development challenges such as nutrition. Through supporting budget analysis exercises and exploring synergies across sectors, there is ample opportunity to ensure more and better investment that delivers wins across areas of health, nutrition, water and sanitation, sustainable agriculture, social protection and beyond.

It provides for food security, human health, the provision of clean air and water; it contributes to local livelihoods, and economic development more generally. It is thus essential for the achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is for this reason that biodiversity and ecosystems are included throughout the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – not only in Goals 14 and 15, but in targets of many others Goals, including SDG 2 (food), 6 (water) 11 (cities), 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production). It is also a key factor to achieve other goals, in particular SDG 1 (poverty eradication). Global multilateral environmental agreements such as the CBD, together with its ‘sister Conventions, the UNFCCC and the UNCCD have a key role to play in contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.    The 196 Parties to the CBD are currently implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its twenty Aichi Biodiversity Targets, from which many elements have been drawn and/or expanded in the 2030 Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the associated targets. The Vision and Mission of this plan make explicit reference to the benefits of biodiversity for all people, to poverty eradication and to human well-being. The Conference of the Parties (the governing body of the Convention), the Secretariat, and the Parties to the Convention are, respectively, providing guidance to implementation of, supporting the implementation of, or implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. In doing so, they are simultaneously providing guidance to implementation of, supporting the implementation of, or implementing, the numerous relevant and interrelated goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda.    There are two Protocols under the Convention: The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, with currently 171 Parties, and the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization, with 104 Parties. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is also supplemented by the Nagoya – Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress which will enter into force on 5 March 2018 with 41 Parties. Their supreme governing bodies are the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to, respectively, the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols. Implementation of the Protocols also supports implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goals 2 (zero hunger), 3 (health), and 15 (life on land).    A description of the interrelations between the Convention on Biological Diversity and the 2030 Agenda is provided in a technical note \"Biodiversity and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\", available online:  https://www.cbd.int/development/doc/biodiversity-2030-agenda-technical-note-en.pdf .    In addition to target 2.5 and 15.6 which are directly related to the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol; access and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources can be an instrument for integrating ecological, social and economic considerations, and therefore contribute to achieve the pertinent SDGs. This is described in the note below.  http://www.abs-initiative.info/fileadmin/media/Knowledge_Center/Pulications/SDG/Policy_Paper_-_How_ABS_and_Nagoya_Protocol_contribute_to_SDGs_-_201604.pdf     Because the many facets of the work under the Convention and its Protocols are so closely aligned with the 2030 Agenda, responding comprehensively to the questions below would lead to a very exhaustive document. Therefore, the responses below focus on the most important facets while specific examples are given for illustrative purposes only.    The vision of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, adopted by the Conference of the Parties in 2010, is: "		Living in Harmony with Nature " where "		By 2050,		biodiversity is valued,		conserved,		restored and wisely used,		maintaining ecosystem services,		sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential		for all people.		"    This 2050 vision was considered by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) at its last meeting, in November 2017, in the context of the 2030 Agenda and the upcoming process under the Convention to develop a post-2020 Global Biodiversity framework, as a successor to the current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets. As some of the targets in the SDGs are a direct reflection of the relevant Aichi Biodiversity Target including its 2020 timeline, this process is of direct relevance to the 2030 Agenda. See further information below.    The Conference of the Parties to the Convention has an established work stream on biodiversity and poverty alleviation and development (see further information under question 2). In this context, it has been active throughout the entire work process on the post-2015 development agenda which led to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015 (see decisions X/6, XI/22 and XII/4).    The theme of the High Level Segment (HLS) during the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties, in 2014, was Biodiversity for Sustainable Development. The HLS adopted the Gangwon Declaration on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development, which highlighted why biodiversity is essential for sustainable development and why development pathways must ensure that the life support system underpinned by biodiversity is maintained. It also highlighted how the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets can contribute to the post-2015 development agenda and the principle of \"leaving no one behind\".  Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the Conference of the Parties adopted a number of decisions to guide its Parties, partners, stakeholders and the Secretariat in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.    Decision XIII/3\tStrategic Actions to Enhance the Implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity including with respect to mainstreaming and the integration of biodiversity within and across sectors    The COP welcomed the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals and recognized the strong interdependence between the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 2020 and the SDGs in which biodiversity is included in numerous goals and targets. It also recognized that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a major opportunity for the mainstreaming of biodiversity and for the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020;    The COP recognized the opportunities that arise from an integrated and mutually supportive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 the 10 year strategic plan and framework to enhance implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (2008-2018), and the Reviewed Strategic Framework 2010-2019 of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for the achievement of internationally agreed goals and targets.    COP urged Parties, when implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to mainstream biodiversity in the implementation of all relevant Sustainable Development Goals, thus promoting linkages between efforts to implement NBSAPs and SDG strategies and plans, and called upon Parties and invites other Governments to consider utilizing an integrated approach towards achieving the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and implementation of NBSAPs;    The COP recognized that fundamental changes in consumption and production patterns to ensure sustainable production methods, as well as mutually supportive policy, legal, technical and financial measures in the agriculture, forests, fisheries and aquaculture, and tourism, among other sectors, are critical to meeting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   Decision XIII/3 highlighted the importance of strengthening the mainstreaming of biodiversity through relevant international processes to guide the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.   The COP recognized that mainstreaming of biodiversity across forests, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, and tourism, among other sectors, is essential for halting the loss of biodiversity and achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and recalls the existing guidance under the Convention's work programmes, as well as the Plan of Action on Customary Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity.  The COP welcomed the Cancun Declaration on mainstreaming the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity for well-being, adopted during the high-level segment of the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, 2016, where ministers and other heads of delegation committed to integrating, in a structured and coherent manner, actions for the conservation, sustainable use, management and restoration of biological diversity and ecosystem services in sectoral and cross-sectoral policies, plans and programmes, as well as in legal and administrative measures and budgets;  The fourteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP-14), will consider the mainstreaming of biodiversity into the sectors of energy and mining, infrastructure, manufacturing and processing, as well as health.   The COP requested the Executive Secretary, to enhance multi-stakeholder partnerships, and initiatives, to provide support for the implementation of Goal A of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Decision XIII/1	Progress in Implementation  The COP encouraged Parties to review their NBSAPs periodically, and to consider increasing the level of ambition and/or scope of the national or regional targets to a level that is corresponding to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and to integrate the targets across different sectors, including in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, so as to make a greater contribution to collective global efforts to achieve the global targets;    The COP encouraged Parties when establishing or reviewing their national targets under the Convention, and when implementing their NBSAPs, to take into account relevant national and international targets under other processes, as appropriate, including targets of other relevant conventions and the Sustainable Development Goals, and also to mainstream biodiversity targets into the national and sub national strategies, action plans or policies of other sectors or processes when these are being reviewed;    The COP encouraged Parties, in the process of updating their NBSAPs, to consider, the indicators for the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals;    The COP initiated a process for considering the follow-up to the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 as part of which it requested the Executive Secretary to prepare a further assessment, including a gap analysis, on the relationship between the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.    Decision XIII/27 	National Reports  Parties to the Convention were required to submit national reports to the Secretariat on measures taken for the implementation of the Convention and their effectiveness. The national report guidance contained in Decision XIII/27 asks countries to report on their contributions to the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and how and to what extent these contributions support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals.   Decision XIII/4	Biodiversity and Climate Change    The COP encouraged the Executive Secretary to promote synergies with the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ensuring that this includes increasing knowledge and sharing of information, guidance and tools developed under the Convention on Biological Diversity relating to the impacts of climate change on biological diversity and the role of ecosystems for climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction, with a view to identifying possible solutions;  The full text of the decisions is available here:  https://www.cbd.int/decisions/cop/?m=cop-13    Decision CP-VIII/3	Capacity-building    The COP/MOP to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety urged Parties and other Governments to integrate biosafety in their national biodiversity strategies and actions plans and broader national development strategies in order to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals. It further encouraged Parties to continue to enhance capacity for, inter alia, initiatives for the Sustainable Development Goals, and requested the Secretariat to undertake regional and subregional workshops and other relevant activities in order to enhance the capacity of Parties to promote such integration.    Decision CP-VIII/15	Third assessment and review of the effectiveness of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and mid-term evaluation of the Strategic Plan    The COP-MOP to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety encouraged Parties to integrate training, public awareness, education and participation into a number of different initiatives including initiatives for the Sustainable Development Goals. It also requested the Executive Secretary to undertake activities to enhance the capacity of Parties to promote the integration of biosafety considerations into national strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.    SBSTTA recommendation XXI/1		The 2050 Vision and the 2030 Agenda  The current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity expires in 2020 and a process is currently initiated under the Convention to develop a post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which would be adopted by CBD COP-15 in China, in 2020. The document provided under the link below provides initial conceptual considerations based on a first round of consultation with Parties, while the recommendation of the Convention's Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice provided pertinent recommendations including a draft decision for consideration by CBD COP-14, which will take place in Egypt in November 2018.    https://www.cbd.int/doc/c/17f8/406d/f3184d92bff8f9506c1e985e/sbstta-21-02-en.doc    https://www.cbd.int/doc/recommendations/sbstta-21/sbstta-21-rec-01-en.docx",

This recognition is enshrined in the preamble of the Convention and in its provisions. It is for this reason that in Article 8(j) of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Parties have undertaken to respect, preserve and maintain the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation of biological diversity and to promote their wider application with the approval of knowledge holders and to encourage equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological diversity.    The programme of work on Article 8(j) and related provisions is the main instrument that Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity have given themselves to achieve the commitments in Article 8(j) and related provisions. One of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (no 18) is also dedicated to this issue. The programme of work has produced significant results, such as:  •\tGuidelines for the conduct of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments (the Akwe: Kon voluntary guidelines for the conduct of cultural, environmental and social impact assessments regarding developments proposed to take place on, or which are likely to impact on, sacred sites and on lands and waters traditionally occupied or used by indigenous and local communities): https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7753   •	The Tkarihwaié:ri Code of Ethical Conduct to Ensure Respect for the Cultural and Intellectual Heritage of Indigenous and Local Communities: https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=12308 ;  •	The global Plan of Action on the Customary Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity: https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=13375   •	The Mo'otz kuxtal  voluntary guidelines for the development of mechanisms, legislation or other appropriate initiatives to ensure the \"prior and informed consent\", \"free, prior and informed consent\" or \"approval and involvement\", depending on national circumstances, of indigenous peoples and local communities  for accessing their knowledge, innovations and practices, for fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of their knowledge, innovations and practices relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and for reporting and preventing unlawful appropriation of traditional knowledge: https://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-13/cop-13-dec-18-en.pdf   The importance attached to indigenous peoples and local communities by the Convention is demonstrative of their importance, including the role of their traditional knowledge and customary sustainable use in attaining the goals of the Convention and more broadly for the Sustainable Development Goals.    More information is available here: https://www.cbd.int/traditional/   3/Women :  The Convention in its preamble recognizes the importance of women's and gender issues in the achievement of biodiversity objectives. The Convention was the first multi-lateral environmental agreement to have a gender plan of action, adopted in 2008.  The plan has since been updated to align with the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020.  The 2015-2020 Gender Plan of Action includes possible actions for Parties as well as a framework for actions by the Secretariat to mainstream gender considerations in work to implement the convention. The objectives of the Plan correspond well with the approach of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Goals, within which gender equality and women's empowerment are addressed as critical cross-cutting components.    See here: https://www.cbd.int/gender/   Efforts by the Secretariat to implement the Gender Plan of Action include:  •	Supporting developing countries to integrate gender considerations in their national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) in collaboration with IUCN's Global Gender Office, and with generous financial support from the Government of Japan.  This work also involved an analysis of gender integration in NBSAPs received by Parties since the establishment of the Convention (from 1993 to mid-2016) and gender integration into the most recent national reports received from Parties (5th national reports on the implementation of the Convention).    •	Preparing informational and capacity building tools, including a pocket guide to the Gender Plan of Action providing a summary and examples of efforts by Parties to implement the Plan; a technical fact sheet on Sustainable Wildlife Management and Gender, produced on behalf of the Collaborative Partnership on Sustainable Wildlife Management; a factsheet on gender perspectives on biodiversity; and others – work which has benefited from the support of the Government of Canada, among others.   •	Undertaking a participatory process to develop training tools on gender and biodiversity that target the South East Asia and Pacific regions, carried out with generous financial support from the Government of Sweden.  These tools are intended to strengthen capacity of national government institutions to address gender considerations in respect to biodiversity policy and programming.  •	Strengthening advocacy and exchange on gender and biodiversity and related environmental issues, including through convening events on these issues at meetings under the Convention, and under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties, as well as engagement supporting training and related efforts by partners.    •	Pursuing efforts to harmonize approaches to capacity building and the achievement of shared gender objectives with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Rio Conventions (UNFCCC and UN Convention to Combat Climate Change), including through provision by the Secretariat of expert input into the development of gender plans of action under the UNFCCC and UNCCD.    Lessons learned from these processes include: the importance of building awareness, engagement and capacity on gender and biodiversity issues, in order to grow momentum and interest enough to realize progress.  Working towards the achievement of gender equality in respect to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, as in other processes, is a long term endeavor, which necessitates ongoing targeted investment and support from a range of partners.  There are clear opportunities to link with and build on the gender-biodiversity/environment linkages in the SDGs with objectives and actions under the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as related work with the Rio Conventions.    4/Youth:  The Secretariat supports youth's efforts in implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Strategic Plan on Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets including by (i) facilitating registration and accreditation of youth groups at the meetings of the Convention and providing support for youth to carry out activities in the margins of the meetings; (iii) developing guidance and tools on youth and biodiversity; (iii) participating in the United Nations Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development; (iv) supporting resource mobilization for youth projects.  By supporting youth engagement in the implementation of the Convention and Strategic Plan on Biodiversity 2011-2020, the Secretariat contributes to strengthening the role of youth in the Sustainable Development Goals. In turn, youth contributes to better integrating biodiversity in SDG-related processes and implementation.  Over the last seven years, the Secretariat, with financial and other support provided by the Japan Biodiversity Fund and several CBD Parties, contributed to \"Youth Voices\" a project implemented by the Global Youth Biodiversity Network (GYBN), aimed at developing the capacities of youth to engage at the political level and in the implementation of the Convention and Aichi Biodiversity Targets and therefore the SDGs. GYBN is an inclusive and representative network of hundreds of youth organizations working on biodiversity. Through the project, GYBN reached out and trained hundreds of youth to participate in decision-making processes under the Convention, through \"Regional Youth Capacity-Building Workshops.\"  The network has a strong social media presence and will further develop online outreach and capacity-building tools and materials on youth and biodiversity. In particular, the publication \"CBD in a Nutshell\" developed by GYBN has become a flagship publication under the Convention. A second edition of the guidelines will be released in 2018.   In January 2018, GYBN in partnership with the UN Major Group for Children and Youth (UN MGCY) moderated a thematic breakout session on SDG15 of the ECOSOC Youth Forum, and organized a side-event on interlinkages between the SDGs and other sustainable development frameworks. The outcomes of the 2018 ECOSOC Youth Forum will serve as inputs to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF 2018).  ",

The Secretariat is already communicating with Parties to the Convention on supporting the biodiversity aspects of voluntary reporting to the HLPF and on the merits of considering the broader indicator framework developed under the Convention for tracking progress against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in reporting progress against the SDGs.  o	On relevant policy tools measures, such as environmental impact assessments, strategic impact assessments, or incentive measures, where the Convention and its Secretariat has also a considerable repository of expertise and guidance already developed.  More generally, key elements of the strategic plan for the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs could include:  •	a review of the current functions and existing capacities of the UN development system in achieving the 2030 Agenda and SDGs;  •	building on insights in addressing gaps and overlaps in support of the SDGs, repositioning development at the highest levels of the organization, to support and enable results at the country level;  •	capacity building and support to countries for implementing the SDGs and relevant multilateral environmental agreements in a coherent manner  •	elements to improve governance, including strengthened oversight by Member States and increased transparency on system-wide results.  Some major challenges to address could be the capacity gaps to support policy integration, data management, partnerships and financing, but also the challenges associated with enhancing coordination and collaboration.

		"q10": "As explained above, implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 has direct bearing on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. However, the current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity expires in 2020 and a process is currently initiated under the Convention to work out a post-2020 strategic biodiversity framework, which would be adopted by CBD COP-15 in China, in 2020. This provides a strategic opportunity to align even more closely the global biodiversity policy agenda with the 2030 agenda, including, but not limited to, providing updates to those targets under the SDGs which, as they originated from the current Strategic Plan for biodiversity, also have a 2020 timeline. Achieving this alignment will require collaboration and will facilitate implementing the Strategic Plan of the UN system in support of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs in a coherent and synergistic manner.  An important initiative that the UN system could potentially undertake together is to further elaborate and operationalize the concepts of ‘Transformation' and ‘Resilience'. Both are thematic foci of the 2018 HLPF, and the former is actually the leading title to the 2030 Agenda itself – ‘Transforming Our World'. Both topics are fundamentally important to the work of the Convention and its Secretariat, due to the urgent imperative of achieving transformational change for attaining the objectives of the Convention, and due to the essential role of biodiversity in ecosystem resilience and, ultimately, in supporting resilient societies (for example, in the context of ecosystem-based climate change mitigation and adaptation and of ecosystem-based disaster risk prevention).  Another initiative that the UN system organizations could undertake together to support the implementation of the SDGs between now and 2030 could be to perhaps put more emphasis on support at the sub national and local levels. The multi-agency working group established by the UN Secretariat with the assistance of UN Habitat, for the implementation of the New Urban Agenda, could provide an important opportunity and entry point for this area of work.

The outcome document, titled \"the Doha Declaration on the Role of Civil Society in the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\", reflects the regional context and advocates for legal frameworks that empower civil society and enhances its role in the implementation and follow-up and review of the SDGs. Later in 2016 and 2017, ESCWA continued its support to networks of NGOs working across the Arab region on SDGs implementation and monitoring. It is expected that in 2018, ESCWA will help launch a dedicated regional CSOs platform that contributes to and interacts directly with relevant regional and global processes.      Engaging with Parliaments and Parliamentarians:    -	Recognizing the role of parliamentarians as stakeholders in the implementation and follow-up and review (FUR) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ESCWA has launched an initiative dedicated to parliamentarians in the Arab region, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Islamic Development Bank Group (IsDB).  The objective is to mainstream the 2030 Agenda and SDGs within the scope of parliamentary work in the Arab region, and across parliamentary functions of representation, legislation, oversight, and budgeting. The initiative specifically responds to SDG-16 whereby parliamentarians and parliaments are empowered as effective, accountable and inclusive institutions to engage with government and non-governmental organizations in a participatory and integrated approach for implementing the 2030 Agenda.      -	The first regional seminar for parliamentarians in the Arab region on implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development took place in November 2017 and resulted in a set of key messages and a draft road map for capacity building, customized knowledge production, and enhanced participation of parliamentarians in the Arab Forum for Sustainable Development and the High Level Political Forum.

Following up on that, the ASDR second edition will be issued in 2019. It utilizes a two-pronged approach to situation analysis and implementation of the 2030 Agenda, presenting a situation report on how the Arab region is doing on each of the SDGs and related targets, in comparison to other regions. It also highlights variations in performance amongst Arab states. The report will show trends in target achievement within the Arab region and where corrective or accelerating measures would be most needed.

While the 2030 Agenda recognizes that the regional dimension plays an important role in achieving the SDGs, more efforts seem to be dedicated to national-level implementation. However, the regional level is not only about linking the national to the global, but it is by itself a critical layer to understand patterns and analyse trends in order to redress or accelerate implementation. In the Arab region, particularly, the UN system should come closer together to help the region face a myriad of challenges that countries alone cannot address. Promoting regional integration at all levels is not the mandate of the regional commissions alone, but also the responsibility of UN country teams and regional offices. Perspectives from the region serve to inform national efforts; likewise, national experiences and successes can have a positive spill-over impact if shared and documented, and if they are part of a collective sustained effort to enhance cooperation and drive transformative change.",

The General Assembly tasked UNISDR to support the implementation, follow-up and review of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. To this end, promoting and supporting a disaster-risk informed approach in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is an important component of UNISDR's work.     The adoption by the General Assembly of the Report of the Open-ended Inter-governmental Expert Working Group (OIEWG) on Indicators and Terminology relating to Disaster Risk Reduction is a commitment to undertaking a disaster risk-informed approach to implementing the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs – recognising that resilient and sustainable societies will only be achieved through the identification, reduction and prevention of disaster risk.     Furthermore, in resolution 72/218 on Disaster Risk Reduction, the General Assembly recognises that disasters hamper the achievement of sustainable development, in particular that of developing countries, and encourages countries and relevant United Nations bodies, agencies, programmes and funds to take into consideration the important role of coordinated disaster risk reduction activities for the achievement of sustainable development. The resolution also encourages States to give appropriate consideration to disaster risk reduction in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, where it is reflected across several Goals and targets, including in their voluntary national reviews.",
		"q2_1": "UNISDR's Strategic Framework 2016-2020 is underpinned by a theory of change in which the reduction of disaster risk is essential to sustainable development, and where a risk-informed development path is key to the successful management of disaster risks. The Strategic Framework is rooted in the understanding that international agreements on disaster risk reduction, sustainable development, financing for development, and climate change mitigation and adaptation present a unique opportunity for increased coherence and global impact.       At the heart of this is the mandate to review progress against the Sendai Framework. Monitoring and reporting progress in disaster risk reduction creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge and evidence generation and application for improved policy and practice, which forms the backbone and underlying rationale of UNISDR's engagement across its strategic objectives. Supporting countries in generating risk data and information, and regular monitoring and reporting on disaster loss, risk and risk reduction practice, create the basis for analysis and evidence. It also is the basis for coherence with international processes on sustainable development and climate change, in particular the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change.    Another key component of UNISDR's Strategic Framework is support to countries in implementing the Sendai Framework, including development of national and local strategies and plans with concrete targets and indicators, aligned with plans on sustainable development and climate change.    UNISDR's Work Programme 2016-2019 is designed to enable UNISDR to facilitate Member States and partners to reduce disaster risk in line with the Sendai Framework and other international agreements. The Results Framework for this Work Programme provides the basis for monitoring progress against the deliverables and results through a set of specific, measurable, achievable and time-bound indicators with respective baselines and targets.     UNISDR also leads the implementation of The United Nations Plan of Action on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience: \"Towards a risk-informed and integrated approach to sustainable development\". The Plan of Action is a significant response to the request by Member States in the 2016 QCPR resolution to enhance coherence, coordination and efficiency at all levels in order to ensure a coherent approach to the interconnections and cross-cutting elements across the SDGs. Through the Plan of Action, the United Nations system is committed to strengthening system-wide coherence in support of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and other agreements that reinforce the 2030 Agenda through a risk-informed approach. United Nations entities have agreed to build their capacity to deliver coordinated high-quality disaster risk reduction support to countries and to maintain disaster risk reduction as a strategic priority. The Plan of Action was endorsed the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination in April 2016. ",

The main objectives of the process were to optimize UNISDR's organizational structure, staffing and working arrangements; increase cost-efficiency; strengthen accountability; and maximize policy and programme coherence and impact in its core areas of work, in order for UNISDR to better position itself to deliver its mandate in alignment with strategic UN system processes, including the 2030 agenda and climate change agenda.     All staff and UNISDR's Senior Leadership Group participated in the design of the change process and agreed on the following priorities:     1) Organizational set-up;  2) Resourcing, both resource mobilization and cost savings to ensure sustainable organization;   3) Internal communication;  4) External communication;  5) People management, including performance management;  6) Staff capacity development;  7) Business processes and policies, including operations workflow and standardized processes; and  8) Partnership engagement strategy.    The new organizational set-up with rationalized functions was rolled out in July 2017, with significant savings (compared to 2016), achieved without staff reduction by reallocating positions to less costly duty stations under the principle of delivering as one team and reducing top heaviness. A business processes review and performance management workshops have further contributed to UNISDR's increased efficiency and effectiveness. New strategies on resource mobilization, partnership engagement and communication and advocacy were also developed.    Member States have commented on how the Change Management Process fits well with the Secretary-General's reform and prevention agenda, by strengthening collaboration with other UN entities, focus on partnerships with other stakeholders, and capacity of Regional Offices to provide targeted support to national and local Governments and UN Country Teams to implement the disaster risk reduction related SDGs and take a risk informed approach to sustainable development.

This is further reaffirmed by the General Assembly in resolution 72/218.      Linked to the development of national and local disaster risk reduction strategies, UNISDR is supporting countries with the development of national disaster loss databases – or the alignment of existing disaster loss databases to the Sendai Framework and SDGs. This includes supporting the collection and management of disaggregated baseline data to conduct disaster risk assessments and produce risk profiles to support the development of national and local disaster risk reduction policies and strategies based on a disaggregated understanding of disaster risk.    UNISDR is also developing a Sendai Framework Monitor enable countries to monitor and report on progress in implementing the Sendai Framework at national level. To this end, UNISDR is leading the development of Technical Guidance for Monitoring and Reporting on Progress in Achieving the Global Targets of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, which provides guidance to countries on desirable disaggregation by geographic location, sex, age, disability, and income to ensure no one is left behind in reporting on progress and in the development of more accurate disaster risk reduction policies and strategies.     UNISDR's new Partnership Strategy builds on the guidance from the Sendai Framework and reflects its all-of-society approach, encompassing UNISDR partnerships with all stakeholders set out in paragraph 35 and 36 of the Sendai Framework. The focus of the strategy is to enable and support partner engagement in the implementation of the Sendai Framework in coherence with other global and regional agreements and to leave no group behind. It thereby applies a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary and inter-generational approach.      Towards integrated policy approaches, the United Nations Senior Leadership Group on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience oversees the strategic and integrated policy aspects of the United Nations Plan of Action on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience. The work of the group ensures linkage and coherence with disaster risk reduction and the other international frameworks of the 2030 Agenda including the SDGs, the Paris Agreement, the new Urban Agenda and other relevant frameworks such.    UNISDR is currently leading on the development of a Global Risk Assessment Framework (GRAF) that seeks to support the requirements of integrated policy development by combining risk assessment and impact analyses across sectors, disciplines and geographies, thereby offering solutions across the social, economic, and environmental spheres, among others.

To this end, UNISDR has developed a series of guidance documents called \"Words into Action\" on implementing the Sendai Framework, which provide practical guidance to policy makers and practitioners on how to implement the Sendai Framework and integrate disaster risk management in a given area.    National Climate Change Adaptation Plans and National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategies to be developed by 2020, as per the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework, are a key opportunity for coherence. UNISDR is working with UNFCCC to develop technical guidance to support countries to develop integrated National Climate Change Adaptation Plans and National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategies. A workshop was convened in Bonn in the margins of the COP in November 2017 and the technical guidance is due to be launched in 2018.     During 2017, the UNISDR Global Education and Training Institute (GETI) delivered 36 training workshops reaching 960 representatives from 63 member states and multi-stakeholder partners (40% women) that supported a deeper understanding of and planning for Sendai Framework implementation at national and local level in coherence with the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development. The training programme focused on understanding disaster risk reduction and the importance of coherent implementation of the Sendai Framework, the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement towards developing integrated plans for resilience. The methodology supports exchange of experience across sectors and stakeholders, and the replication of materials and use of localized materials towards sustainable disaster risk reduction capacity development.    Between May and October 2017, UNISDR conducted a series of regional capacity development consultations as well as an on-line consultation, towards developing a Global Capacity Development Strategy to support the implementation of the Sendai Framework. The consultation process aimed to understand the most urgent capacity development needs for Sendai Framework implementation and disaster risk sensitive sustainable development planning; to highlight gaps and opportunities; consult on the most appropriate solutions to address the evolving needs; and to establish a way forward to support disaster risk reduction capacity development programming.

Disaster risk reduction indicators of SDGs 1, 11 and 13 share common indicators and datasets with the Sendai Framework targets. UNISDR is working to develop the infrastructure of a Sendai Framework Monitor (SFM) to enable countries to report on-line on the Sendai Framework and on related targets and indicators of the SDGs. The development of an online version of the Sendai Framework Monitor is underway, with the first release date planned for March 2018. A set of optional national indicators has been developed that may be selected and tailored by countries to measure nationally determined targets and priorities aligned with the Sendai Framework. The first report of the Sendai Framework Monitor will be prepared for consideration at the HLPF convened under the auspices of the General Assembly in 2019.    As previously mentioned, UNISDR has produced Technical Guidance Note which will assist Member States to collect and report data for Sendai Framework Monitor as well as SDGs monitoring. UNISDR has conducted several technical workshops, most recently from December 6 to 8 in Bonn to provide technical information that will be useful for countries in developing their capacities for data collection and reporting to the disaster risk reduction related SDGs and the Sendai Framework targets.    As mentioned above, during the past decade UNISDR has promoted and supported the development of disaster loss databases. National loss and damage databases are instrumental in generating accurate date for country risk profiles and enhancing knowledge and understanding of risk with a view to designing multi-hazard disaster risk policies and adopting a risk-informed approach to sustainable development based on a localized understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions. Recently, UNISDR has released a new version of the DesInventar software which fully implements the set of new indicators required by the OEIWG report for Sendai Framework Targets A to D. This system will be able to consolidate data in annual form and pass it to the central Sendai Framework Monitor via an automated interface, reducing the burden of countries.    With a robust monitoring framework in place it is important to survey the availability of national disaster-related data, capacity gaps and resources needed to fill them and the availability of current baselines from which to measure the global targets of the Sendai Framework. In February 2017, UNISDR conducted a Sendai Framework data readiness review of 87 countries. Over 90 per cent of countries indicated the need for financial resources to cover data gaps, and many countries, particularly those in special situations, face significant capacity gaps and technological deficiencies which hinder their ability to track progress.    A comprehensive approach to data enhancement is required to address data availability, accessibility, application and quality if all countries are to effectively contribute to the first report of the Sendai Framework Monitor by 2019. At the behest of Member States (NSOs at the UN World Data Forum 2017 in Cape Town), UNISDR has established the Global Partnership for Disaster-related Statistics, together with UNECE, UNESCAP, and UNECLAC and partner organizations as a multi-stakeholder initiative to assist countries in filling gaps in disaster-related data, building national capacity and improving data quality, while also mobilizing political support.    The Sendai Framework Monitor will serve multiple purposes for Member States, regional intergovernmental organizations and local governments. It enables progress to be tracked in implementing the Sendai Framework across sectors, as well as related dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change adaptation. It will simultaneously function as a management tool to help countries develop disaster risk reduction strategies, make risk-informed policy decisions and allocate resources to prevent new disaster risks. Together with national disaster loss databases, the Sendai Framework Monitor can contribute to the development of actionable national and local disaster risk reduction policies and strategies by 2020 on the basis of on credible data, evidence and available capacities.",

New members of the STAG were appointed in summer 2017, with regional STAGs in development in all regions. Science and technology partners support the implementation of the Sendai Framework through the Science and Technology Roadmap, a focused action plan adopted by science and technology partners at the first Science and Technology Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction in January 2016. Technology is becoming more prominent in the deliberations of the groups, including through a new workstream on Natural Hazard Triggering Technological Disasters agreed at the annual meeting of the STAG in December 2017. Technology partners will be invited to join the STAGs, including through close collaboration will be established through the UNISDR Private Sector Alliance for Disaster Resilient Societies (ARISE).    Another relevant area of work is the Global Risk Assessment Framework (GRAF), which is in the early stages of development. It is conceived so as to respond to the significantly broadened scope of disaster risk identified by Member States in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and which following inclusion of disaster risk metrics in the monitoring framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, also support risk-informed realization of the SDGs.  In so doing, risks related to biological, environmental, technological, natural and man-made, small-scale and large-scale, sudden and slow-onset disasters are included under a single framework. The GRAF would represent the state of the art across a wider spectrum of hazards, with a greatly reinforced emphasis on, and understanding of, vulnerability, exposure and impact, at relevant and appropriate scale across sectors and geographies.

A key element of the strategy is to build synergies and collaboration between and across stakeholder groups.",
		"q3_6": "UNISDR, through its five Regional Offices is providing normative guidance and technical support to Governments at national and local levels in aligning existing national disaster risk reduction strategies - or developing new ones - in line with the Sendai Framework to support the advancement of the SDGs at country level. UNISDR's support includes capacity development and policy guidance to Parliamentarians to develop their national DRR policies or related laws. Strong emphasis is being placed in integrating disaster risk reduction and sustainable development in all regions so to build a coherent approach to reducing risks at the national and local levels.     At local level, UNISDR is engaging local authorities and municipalities through the Resilient Cities Campaign and related tools (scorecard) in assessing their risks and vulnerabilities and supporting them with the development of local DRR strategies and plans while enhancing the correlation with the climate change adaptation and SDGs. For example, UNISDR Regional Office for Africa supported 50 cities in performing their self-risk assessment using the scorecard and facilitated 152 cities in joining the Making Cities Resilient campaign. In the Americas, a network of nearly 1200 municipalities participating in the Resilient Cities was built, directly addressing indicator 11b of the SDGs.",

The shared indicators respond to the underlying principles of the 2030 Agenda to enhance coherence and simplicity and reduce the reporting burden for countries. Shared indicators can promote coherence through streamlined reporting against both agreements and the use of common multi-purpose datasets and can contribute to the identification of areas of mutual reinforcement where disaster risk reduction and sustainable development intersect. At the last meeting of the IAEG-SDG held Manama, UNISDR was invited to make a presentation about the Sendai Framework Monitor as a good example of \"progress by custodian agencies on methodological development and other implementation activities on SDG indicators\".    UNISDR is member of UNWater and will participate at the 28th UN-Water meeting on the 1-2 February. UNISDR has been invited to jointly draft a section of SDG 11.5 in the \"UN-Water SDG 6 Synthesis Report 2018\" to be reported at the 2018 HLPF. UNISDR is also engaged in the implementation of the International Decade for Action on Water for Sustainable Development to raise awareness and improve understanding of water-related disasters risks and their impacts, and ensure a risk-informed approach to the implementation o0f the Decade.    UNISDR has also supports the CEB on disaster risk reduction issues, most recently on revising the UN Plan of Action on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience and the disaster risk reduction elements of the UN System Strategic Approach on Climate Change Action.",
		"q6": "UNISDR is promoting a unique multi-stakeholder, whole-of-society and inclusive approach to reducing risks and vulnerabilities to disasters. To do so, UNISDR is actively engaging a wide variety of core stakeholder groups and networks of partners to mobilize their expertise and contribution to implementing the Sendai Framework and relevant SGD targets at their respective level and mainstreaming disaster risk reduction within their relevant sectors as outlined below:    •\tScience and Technology  All UNISDR Regional Offices are mobilizing the scientific and technical expertise available in their respective region to facilitate the implementation of the scientific components of the Sendai Framework through the development of regional Science and Technology Advisory Groups (Regional STAGs). These regional groups mirror the work and structure of a global Science and Technology Group (Global STAG) coordinated through UNISDR HQ with the same objectives. These groups serve to mobilize the scientific, academic and technical expertise to build scientific evidence to disaster risk reduction through the collection, analysis and management of reliable scientific and technical disaster information and data to support and influence DRR decision-making and investment. In Arab States, the Arab Science and Technology Advisory Group for DRR is in the process of being established (TORs in development) and will specifically support scientific research of disaster risk patterns, causes and effects to support the availability and application of science and technology to decision-making. The composition and modalities of work of each regional STAG may vary according to the source of expertise or capacity available. In the Americas for instance, the Science and Technology Advisory Group is led through a network of universities called REDULAC (Latin America and Caribbean Network of Universities for Disaster Risk Reduction). Similarly, in Africa, UNISDR's regional Office for Africa (ROAF) is supporting Periperi U, a partnership of 12 African universities committed to building local disaster risk related capacity, as a possible lead partner for the African STAG. In Asia, UNISDR Asia Science Technology Academia Advisory Group (ASTAAG) is a key mechanism that works to implement the Asian Science and Technology Roadmap and convenes biennial science and technology conferences on DRR.    •	Private sector  UNISDR has developed over the past five years a Global Alliance of Private Sector for Disaster Risk Reduction (Global ARISE) that groups together private sector companies interested and engaged in ensuring the private sector's resilience to disasters through business continuity and the promotion of risk sensitive investments. Several regions (Europe, Americas, Arab States replicated the development of the Global ARISE at the regional level with the development of Regional ARISE networks. In the Arab region, this subjects starts gaining prominence and three private sector representatives are now members of the Arab States Private Sector Alliance for Disaster Resilient Societies. The active engagement of the private sector in disaster risk reduction is also reaching out to national level. In the Americas for instance, UNISDR Regional Office for the Americas (ROAM) continued expanding the network of private sector in the Americas with the launch of eight new national ARISE networks. In Asia Pacific, UNISDR Regional Office for Asia Pacific has supported the establishment of ARISE national platforms in Japan, Fiji and Philippines and in the process of forming one in India. Also, in consultation with partners and private sector, UNISDR developed a revised toolkit on business continuity planning. The Chambers of Commerce have expressed interest to further tailor the toolkit to be sector specific i.e. for manufacturing, services and agriculture, demonstrating increased demand from the private sector to integrate DRR tools in their work.  In the Pacific, having validated the usefulness of the toolkit, the Fiji Business Disaster Resilience Council has sought UNISDR's technical support in the roll-out of basic BCP training across Fiji and three other Pacific countries in 2018.    UNISDR is a founding member of the Insurance Development Forum (IDF). The IDF aims to optimise and extend the use of insurance and its related risk management capabilities to build greater resilience and protection for people, communities, businesses, and public institutions that are vulnerable to disasters and their associated economic shocks. The SRSG for DRR sits on the Steering Committee, and UNISDR Co-Chairs one of the working groups.  The Sendai Framework recognizes that, though the primary responsibility to reduce risks lies with governments, stakeholders have a very strong role to play in supporting efforts in assessing and reducing disaster risk at all levels.    •	Civil society  UNISDR is making particular efforts to reach out to and engage civil society in reducing disaster risks, including NGOs, community-based organizations and the most vulnerable groups such as women, youth, persons with disabilities, indigenous groups, the elderly etc. through a structured mechanisms of leader appointment for each group and the mobilization of core partners at community level (such as IFRC, women groups and network of NGOs and practitioners), through awareness-raising campaigns and capacity building opportunities.     UNISDR Asia Pacific for instance is partnering with the Asia Disaster Reduction and Response Network (ADRRN) and with community practitioners (e.g. through Huairou Commission) that convene the civil society voices for DRR coordination in the region. Strong focus is being placed on youth in most regions and a Youth Engagement Platform (YEP) for Disaster Risk Reduction was developed to engage youth from all regions in supporting Governments in implementing the Sendai Framework and integrating youth's considerations and innovative approaches to reducing risks and vulnerabilities and in building the resilience of future generations to disasters.     UNISDR Office for the Arab States launched the Arab Youth for Resilience campaign 2017- 2020 which focuses on building youth capacities to contribute to the implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement for Climate Change. In each region, Regional Platforms for Disaster Risk Reduction are held every two years and integrate youth components, including a pre-Youth Forum (Asia, Arab States, Americas, Africa, Pacific) during which youth are actively engaged in contributing to regional discussions.     •	Local Governments  UNISDR, through its regional offices, is working closely with local governments in assessing their risk and in developing local disaster risk reduction strategies and plans in the context of the Resilient Cities Campaign. (see all details under 3, local level)    •	Parliamentarians   Building on its 10 year work with Parliamentarians to foster a political environment to achieve sustainable communities resilient to disasters, UNISDR's Parliamentarian Initiative in 2016-2017 intensified its efforts supporting members of parliament understanding and implementing the Sendai Framework enabling the creation of better laws and regulations, informed budgets and stronger accountability, as well as coherent approach between the implementation of the Sendai Framework, the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement.  In particular, this supported disaster-risk related SDGs such as Goals 1, 11, 13 which are directly connected to the Sendai Framework through common indicators. It also supports SDG 9, 12, 14, 16 and 17.     The main DRR event in 2017, the 2017 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction saw the active attendance of many Parliamentarians and Parliamentarian networks, including at a Parliamentarian Side Event which agreed on future technical support by UNISDR to Parliamentarian partners including training and guidance materials in close collaboration with IPU. This builds on collaboration such as the IPU-led Regional Seminar on SDGs for the Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe in Bucharest in April 2016 where UNISDR introduced the Sendai Framework as a critical element for the achievement of the SDGs. Lawmakers also attended the Regional Platforms for DRR, held in all five UNISDR regions as well as other UNISDR-led global and regional events. In his Opening Address to the 2016 \"Women in Parliament Summit\" the SRSG encouraged the Arab Region to pursue risk reduction and gender issues through the UNISDR-WIP Caucus of Women for the DRR.     In March 2016, the assembly of the East African Community (EAC) passed the EAC Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act. As culmination of a process initiated by UNISDR in 2010, it is the first such regional legislation in Africa. Over the course of 2017, EAC parliamentarians developed a roadmap for the implementation of the Act, including priorities such as awareness raising of the legislation amongst various target groups, strengthening regional coordination, better networking across institutions and sectors and enhanced regional and national capacity development on disaster risk reduction, and partnerships.     In 2016, UNISDR and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) provided training to the Parliamentarians Network for Resilience to Disasters in Central Africa (REPARC), set up in October 2015 to address disaster risk reduction and climate change issues in the region, with a key focus on coherence between the post-2015 agreements.    European parliamentarians actively engaged through the European Parliament Disaster Risk Reduction network and the 2017 European Forum for Disaster Risk Reduction Open Forum. Outcomes of this engagement included the European Parliament resolution on 1 June 2017 on ‘Resilience as a Strategic Priority of the External Action of the EU', embedding the Sendai Framework in EU foreign policy priorities. In addition, the European Parliament continued to support the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities in the implementation of the Sendai Framework. As part of a new agreement between UNISDR and the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) on DRR advocacy, local Parliamentarians adopted an option in March 2017 on the Sendai Framework Action Plan.    In the Americas region, UNISDR signed an agreement with Parlamericas focusing on raising awareness raising and information exchange in the region and globally to promote and influence risk-informed decision-making and legislation; facilitating the engagement of parliamentarians in regional, national and global Sendai Framework implementation, supporting an all-of-society approach by actively engaging other core stakeholder groups.     Parliamentarians in Asia-Pacific region are organized through the Asian Advisory Group of Parliamentarians for Disaster Risk Reduction. Parliamentarians from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Japan and Nepal participated in the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in November 2016 in India, organised by UNISDR, and issued a Statement of Action highlighting their commitments and recognizing the unique opportunity to achieve risk-resilient and sustainable development through the implementation of the Sendai Framework. They also developed a roadmap to implement the Sendai Framework in the region including through increasing the understanding of the parliamentarians on disaster risk, strengthening legislation across development sectors while integrating disaster risk reduction, and enhancing risk-sensitive investments and accountability.

		"q7": "The Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, as recognized by the UN General Assembly, is the main forum at the global level for strategic advice, coordination and partnership development and for monitoring and reviewing progress in the implementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. One of the main functions of the Global Platform is to share practice and knowledge on disaster risk-informed policies, programmes and investments, including on development and climate issues. The outcomes of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction inform the deliberations of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development from disaster risk reduction perspective.     The fifth session of the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction took place in Cancun, Mexico, from 24 to 26 May, 2017. The event was attended by over 4,000 participants and it reaffirmed the remarkable commitment of Member States and stakeholders to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Member States stressed that the full implementation of the Sendai Framework will also reinforce their efforts to meet their obligations under the Paris Agreement and to achieve the SDGs. Member States reaffirmed the role of the Global Platform as the global multi-stakeholder mechanism for accelerating implementation, monitoring the progress and ensuring coherence with other global frameworks, in particular with the SDGs and Paris Agreement.    The sixth session of the Global Platform will take place in Geneva, Switzerland from 13 to 17 May, 2019. It will represent the next important opportunity for the international community to boost the implementation of the Sendai Framework, in coherence with SDGs, and it will allow for the first time to take stock on the progress made based on data submitted by Member States. The outcomes of the next Global Platform will be submitted to the HLPF in 2019.    At the regional level, all UNISDR Regional Offices are facilitating the organization of biennial multi-stakeholder Regional Platforms for Disaster Risk Reduction in close collaboration with interested Host Governments that serve to:  •Assess progress, identify gaps and monitor the implementation of the Sendai Framework at regional level and regional DRR strategy and action plan;  •Guide Governments in policy-making, understanding risk and implementing the Sendai Framework at regional and national levels  •Foster sharing of lessons learned and good practices for replication;  •Forge innovative partnerships in disaster risk reduction in the region.    The Regional Platforms are also increasingly recognized as instrumental in building coherence across the DRR, sustainable development and climate change agendas at regional and national levels.     The latest Regional Platforms include:  AFRICA: Africa Regional Platform for DRR, November 2016, Mauritius  •Organized in cooperation with the African Union   •Evaluated progress and identified and prioritized key actions to accelerate the implementation of the Africa Programme of Action and the Sendai Framework in Africa.   •Endorsed the Programme of Action for the Implementation of the Sendai Framework in Africa   •Adopted the Mauritius Declaration on the Implementation of the Sendai Framework in Africa   •Shaped the Africa Common Position to the 2019 Global Platform for DRR    AMERICAS: Fifth Regional Platform for DRR for the Americas, March 2017, Montreal, Canada  •More than 1000 delegates participated in the RP, including policy makers, practitioners, experts and disaster risk managers.   •Included a Ministers and High-Level Authorities meeting.   •Main focus was on providing an opportunity to having an in-depth discussion of Priority 1 - Understanding disaster risk, an area of particular interests in the Americas region where knowledge gaps constituted one of the mayor causes of uneven advances towards DRR.  •Adopted the Regional Action Plan and Montreal Declaration to support the implementation of the Sendai Framework in the Americas, approved by national country representatives.

The IRRF articulates expected results during UN-Women's Strategic Plan cycle of 2018-2021 and defines the metrics (indicators, baselines, milestones and targets) that will be used to measure progress and assess the effectiveness and impact of the plan. The IRRF also outlines estimated resources necessary for the achievement of each outcome. The IRRF is a key instrument for UN-Women to measure its performance, promote learning and programming adjustments, and inform decision-making to optimize the implementation of the Strategic Plan. This integrated framework brings together development results and organizational effectiveness and efficiency results. In addition, the framework links outcomes to financial resources on the basis of a specific methodology. The integrated nature of the framework emphasizes the interconnection between UN-Women's internal capacity, institutional enablers and necessary inputs, including financial resources, with the changes the Entity seeks to contribute to towards achieving gender equality and women's empowerment. In order to ensure strong alignment with other relevant existing frameworks, the IRRF includes relevant indicators from the global framework to monitor Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as agreed by the UN Statistical Commission; the monitoring framework of the 2016 quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the UN system (QCPR) coordinated by the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs; as well as shared indicators with UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF.

The Entity offers support to ensure women's organizations are engaging as key stakeholders in the efforts at national and sub-national level.  UN Women particularly partners with networks of women living with HIV, in all their diversities, to ensure they are key players in the HIV response.  In 2016, UN Women collaborated with the International Community of Women Living with HIV in 10 countries in the organization of workshops that trained over 200 women living with HIV on how to advocate the inclusion of their perspectives in policy-making to localize the 2030 Agenda.  A Guide to the SDGs for the Network of Women Living with HIV was developed and disseminated; it outlines key strategies to ensure SDGs implementation works for women living with HIV.      UN Women supports the achievement of SDG target 5.5, ‘Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life'.  The Entity works with the Inter-Parliamentary Union in supporting the elimination of discriminatory laws on women's political participation and provides technical support to parliamentarians, parliamentary gender equality committees and women's caucuses to institutionalize gender-sensitive procedures and practices. Together with partner agencies such as UNDP, UN Women prepared guidelines promoting gender equality in electoral processes and preventing violence against women participating in political and electoral processes.

The proposed methodology has been successfully pilot tested.  The proposed methodology covers four areas of law and 45 questions drawn from the international legal and policy framework on equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing Platform for Action. The three agencies plan to present the proposal to the IAEG-SDGs in the spring 2018 with a request for upgrade to tier II. Indicator 5.1.1 will be crucial in accelerating progress by tracking the removal of discriminatory laws and adoption of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality.  •	In 2017, UN Women finalized the methodology of SDG Indicator 5.5.1b, ‘proportion of seats held by women in local government'. In the process, UN Women collaborated closely with the UN regional commissions and engaged with national stakeholders, including National Statistical Offices, Electoral Management Bodies and national gender equality mechanisms (Ministries) in different countries and regions, to ensure that their unique perspectives and needs are accounted for in the methodological design of SDG indicator 5.5.1b and in the planning of future capacity building activities. Collaboration with the Regional Commissions will also be pursued in the future data compilation for SDG monitoring.   •	UN Women, together with the OECD and UNDP refined the methodology of SDG Indicator 5.c.1, ‘proportion of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment'. This collaboration will continue for the data collection process. The methodology refinement entailed consultations with stakeholders including ministries of finance, national gender equality mechanisms, civil society organizations, international financial institutions and academia. Going forward, UN-Women will support ministries of finance to report on this SDG indicator. In this context, UN-Women will strengthen capacity of national statistical offices, national gender equality mechanisms (Ministries), sectoral ministries, and civil society organizations to validate the data through the provision of on-demand technical support.   •	UN Women contributes to work for the development of content and monitoring frameworks for indicators pertaining to peace and security, particularly of SDG 16.

UN Women works closely with and through the entities of the UN system in the delivery of its mandate.  This approach is reflected in UN Women's Strategic Plan 2018-2021, its Flagship Programming Initiatives which were launched as multi-stakeholder programmatic platforms to support increased impact across the SDGs; the system-wide action plan for gender equality and the empowerment of women (UN-SWAP), its work in the context of the UNCTs, to name a few.  UN Women has been and continues to be actively engaged in key inter-agency fora that have spearheaded enhanced UN system coherence and synergies in recent years.  These include: co-leading on the development of a system wide (CEB) framework on Leave No One Behind; within the UNDG, co-leading the updating of the UNDAF guidelines that provide  programming guidance to UNCTs, ensuring a strong focus on human rights and gender equality as a key programming principle under the overall umbrella of Leave No One Behind; within the UNDG co-leading the UN working group on strategic financing, including on the role of pooled financing mechanisms to foster collective action; leading and/or co-leading gender equality coordination groups within regional UNDGs to foster joint action at the regional level and support to UNCTs; working with RCs and UNCTs to strengthen gender mainstreaming at the country level, in the context of the SDGs. UN Women chairs the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality, which meets once annually and virtually on a regular basis to enhance coordination and synergies.   The common chapter contained in the Strategic Plans of UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and UN Women is a concrete example of how to realize stronger substantive coherence. The common chapter identifies key areas where the four entities will leverage their collaborative advantages for increased impact. Those areas are also fully aligned with the flagship initiatives proposed by the Secretary-General through the System Wide Strategic Document (SWSD), with gender equality and the empowerment of women featuring prominently in both documents.   Stronger substantive coherence of the UN system must benefit the people the UN system serves on the ground. For UN Women, strategic repositioning means strengthening the system's collective capacity to deliver better results for women and girls. To achieve this, the next generation of UNDAFs must strengthen these key aspects: 1) fostering the linkages and coherence across the development, humanitarian and peace building pillars; 2) reaffirming the centrality of international norms and standards for UNCT programming; and 3) securing a specific focus on eliminating inequalities and discrimination, including on the basis of gender.  UN Women has been instrumental in securing the centrality of human rights and gender equality as programming principles for UNCTs through the UNDAF. Investing in making the UNDAF gender-responsive is an imperative for UN Women. Currently, 62 per cent of UNDAFs feature gender specific outcome results, up from 47 per cent before the Entity was established in 2010. Gender equality is also the number one area of concentration of Joint Programmes implemented by UNCTs (109 out of total 378). UN Women will continue to work towards securing strong gender equality and gender mainstreaming capacity within the UNCTs to help prepare CCAs, develop UNDAFs, convene results groups and engage in joint programmes on gender equality as a prerequisite for delivering results for women and girls.

In addition, UNCDF has developed data-driven diagnostics that reveal markets and trends, and empower governments to define financial inclusion strategies tailored to their circumstances and needs. These tools create strong national platforms for donor coordination and private sector engagement. UNCDF will continue to deploy such approaches, building capacities and reinforcing coordination among stakeholders, especially regulators and financial service providers.",
		"q3_4": "After identifying unmet needs where the lack of access to finance holds back development, UNCDF provides a mix of technical assistance and capital instruments to help its partners design and test innovations in response. Through its demonstration effect, UNCDF prepares the ground for public and private stakeholders to replicate and scale up viable models.    In financial inclusion, digital innovations have revolutionized the way financial services are provided and used, and have created new business models to expand access to basic goods and services. Leveraging this digital revolution, UNCDF seeks to address a growing range of ‘real economy' challenges linked to the sustainable development goals, such as improving agriculture productivity for smallholder farmers and value chain actors, enabling access to clean energy and other basic services, or supporting micro-, small and medium-sized enterprise growth, including in such sectors such as the ‘fintech' industry. These interventions especially target women and youth. UNCDF also uses its capital tools and technical assistance to incentivize financial services providers to design and deliver client-centric product innovations using alternative delivery channels – such as rural agents, mobile phones, point-of-sales devices, and informal community groups – to reach underserved populations, especially women, youth, and smallholder farmers. UNCDF support to financial service providers and other partners seeks a demonstration impact that will help other service providers to replicate successful innovations. By creating safe spaces for piloting smart products and delivery channels – such as the innovation labs in Uganda and the Pacific – UNCDF helps unlock the balance sheets of large commercial actors to reach the un-and under-banked with new services. In local development finance, UNCDF collaborates with governments and other partners, often through multiple generations of innovations, first to create viable models and then to help them scale approaches to fiscal decentralization, project finance, and municipal finance. This can lead to increased local revenue through taxes and fees – as well as second-round effects through growing local economies – as can UNCDF work building the capacities of local authorities to improve the accountability of their tax administration.

With regards IFIs, UNCDF will continue to engage with these partners to maximize replication and scale potential, including collaborating with regional banks on market development in financial inclusion and ecosystems for digital payments. UNCDF will seek to partner strategically with international financial institutions in deploying financial instruments in ways that harness the respective collaborative advantages of each entity in support of least developed countries.     UNCDF works with a wide range of private sector actors as innovators, implementing partners, and possibly funders.

",
		"q3_6": "A core part of UNCDF is premised on the fact that while the 2030 Agenda is global, it will be ultimately implemented at the local level with the participation of local governments and local stakeholders. In its local development finance work, UNCDF focuses on innovating finance models that bring localities and excluded populations into the development mainstream. In supporting least developed countries to build inclusive, resilient economies, UNCDF adopts a transformative-impact financing approach to promote service delivery, infrastructure investment, and local economic development that retains value within a local territory. UNCDF seed capital and technical assistance will focus on helping localities build local fiscal space and local fixed capital formation.   Working with local governments, domestic banks, and local businesses, UNCDF provides evidence-based in-country analysis that informs the local development processes in the fields of fiscal decentralization, local public finance, and own resource revenues.  To create the demonstration effects needed to support wider shifts in sustainable development goals financing, UNCDF helps least developed countries design and pilot financing mechanisms and business models that support locally designed public investments and revenue-generating capital investment projects. These are applied to addressing specific development bottlenecks.    In 2017, UNCDF and UN-DESA/Financing for Development Office published a \"Financing for Sustainable Urban Development in the Least Developed Countries\". The publication is designed to promote knowledge sharing amongst stakeholders in urban finance and local sustainable development. Its prime objective is to support government officials in least developed countries at the local and national levels to strengthen their urban finance frameworks.  ",

At the national level, UNCDF works with government entities as well as private sector partners such as mobile network operators and SMEs to make finance work for the poor. Lessons include that well-designed partnerships can take advantage of the unique skills and technologies that different entities can bring to the table, bringing maximum benefit to poor households.

Second, it is crucial for such a plan to have a strong focus on supporting developing countries to be able to finance SDG achievement. The UN has a critical role to play through its leadership, normative and convening roles; its innovation and knowledge sharing; and its relationship of trust with governments to identify and address gaps so that financing works for inclusion.  It is mission critical for the UN system not only to accompany the move from \"billions to trillions\", but to help unlock those trillions.The UN can also help governments coordinate, track, allocate, and account for these sources of financing so that they are working together effectively to meet the SDGs; to tap those sources that may not be productively working toward positive SDG achievement (e.g., excess liquidity in domestic banks, domestic pension funds); and to redirect (through concessional finance and other innovation approaches) financial flows for greater transformational impact. This means the UN itself needs the right financing skills and expertise to be able to accompany greater flows of finance into investments that are SDG-positive. To this end, the UN should draw on existing finance capacities and experiences within the UNDS.  The UNDS does not have the volume and capacity to drive the needed funding to financing changes 32 times over, nor should it. While individual agencies will continue to pursue relevant innovations on their own, the common system needs to organize itself to implement the shift recommended in this paper at scale.    ",

		"q1": "Regional Commissions have undertaken fit for purpose exercises for some years now.  ESCAP convened the first Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development in 2014, and undertook an independent conference structure evaluation in 2016, which resulted in the addition of Financing for Development and Science, Technology and innovation in the subsidiary structure of the Commission supported by dedicated sections in ESCAP, allowing comprehensive coverage of the means of implementation in ESCAP's work. ESCAP's long-standing work on energy was elevated with the establishment of a Committee on Energy supported by a full-fledged Energy Division. These steps ensured that the ESCAP conference and secretariat structure were fully aligned with the 2030 agenda. In 2017, the Commission formally established the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development as part of the conference structure and adopted the Regional road map for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, which sets out the sustainable development priorities of the region and is the expressed will of the countries of Asia and the Pacific on the assistance they require from UNDS at the regional level for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.  ESCAP has also set up a SDG response facility to respond to requests from member States on implementation of the SDGs.     The Asia-Pacific Regional Coordination Mechanism convened by ESCAP was also restructured in 2016 to be fully aligned with the 2030 Agenda. Seven Thematic Working Groups (TWGs) have been created on Statistics, Resource Efficient Growth, Sustainable Societies, Inclusive Development and Poverty Eradication, Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience, Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women and Education 2030+. These correspond to the respective clusters of SDGs.     To advance its commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the Commission adopted resolution 72/6 on Committing to the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific. Actions called for in the resolution were further endorsed by the ECOSOC resolution 2016/11. The Commission requested the Executive Secretary (a) to promote the balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development and provide annual updates and recommendations to member States, including through the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development; (b) to support the process to define a regional road map for implementing the 2030 Agenda and to address challenges to its achievement in Asia and the Pacific, pursuant to the recommendations of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, as contained in its report; (c) to strengthen support to member States in their efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda in an integrated approach, inter alia, with analytical products, technical services and capacity-building initiatives through knowledge-sharing products and platforms, and to enhance data and statistical capacities; and (d) to continue to provide capacity-building opportunities to member States, leveraging existing expertise and its intergovernmental forum to contribute to the strengthening of their capacity, including through support for mainstreaming financing for development issues in areas such as domestic resource mobilization, as well as through support for their efforts in developing integrated approaches, models and tools in enhancing their regional cooperation on the Sustainable Development Goals with a special emphasis on the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.    Following the adoption of resolution 72/6, the countries of Asia and the Pacific have developed the Regional road map for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to facilitate cooperation at the regional level supported by the ESCAP Secretariat and other United Nations entities. The road map was agreed on during the 4th Asia Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development and adopted by the Commission at its 73rd session through resolution 73/9 on Regional road map for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific. The resolution called for enhanced cooperation among relevant organizations in the United Nations system and other stakeholders in the region in support of the Regional road map for implementing the 2030 Agenda in Asia and the Pacific. The Regional road map, which promotes the balanced integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development through regional cooperation in a set of priority areas that support effective pursuit of sustainable development by member States, serves as a framework for regional cooperation and support in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, in particular by least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States, countries in conflict situations and post-conflict countries and other countries with special needs in the region.    The Regional road map embodies ESCAP's vision for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SGDs.

		"q2_1": "The inclusion of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development (APFSD) as the subsidiary structure of the Commission through the adoption of resolution 73/1 on A conference structure of the Commission aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has reaffirmed ESCAP's role in the follow-up and review of the implementation of 2030 Agenda at the regional level to feed into the high-level political forum on sustainable development (HLPF) at the global level.     To fully assume such a role, the programme of work for the biennium of 2018-2019 has been optimized in line with the 2030 Agenda and SDGs.    i. The most inclusive regional intergovernmental platform for the follow-up and review of the progress of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs:    Pursuant to ESCAP resolution 72/6 on Committing to the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific, Governments and other stakeholders convene at the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development on a theme set by the HLPF. This forum will engage member States, United Nations and other institutions, and major groups and other stakeholders including civil society organizations in dialogue on regional perspectives on the implementation and the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including in-depth review of the theme and SDGs.     Better coordination with member States has been achieved through close consultation with the Advisory Committee of Permanent Representatives and Other Representatives Designated by Members of the Commission, through national ESCAP coordination focal points, designated by countries at ESCAP's request, and through a dedicated space for activities on the 2030 Agenda on the ESCAP website. Member States have been consulted thoroughly in the organization of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development and the preparation of the Regional Road Map. The process of developing the draft involved consultation through the Advisory Committee, the circulation of successive drafts to Governments, civil society and members of the Regional Coordination Mechanism, and consultations with the Advisory Committee in an informal session. In response to subparagraph 7 (c) in resolution 72/6, ESCAP has contributed to national implementation efforts with analytical products, technical services provided to subregional institutions and programmes, and capacity-building in various areas, in particular in relation to strengthening follow-up and review and through knowledge platforms and products.     The fourth session of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development was concluded in March 2017 with the adoption of the Regional road map for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific, which was subsequently endorsed by the 73rd session of the ESCAP Commission in the same year. The Regional road map identified priority areas for regional cooperation and collaboration among member States with emphasis on practical means of implementation to achieve SDGs. These key areas, namely data and statistics, technology, financing for development, policy coherence, regional partnerships, social development, disaster risk reduction and resilience, climate change, management of natural resources, connectivity, and energy, also lay out the direction and approaches of ESCAP's normative, analytical and capacity building work, as well as strategic partnerships with UN agencies and other stakeholders.    ii. The Regional Coordination Mechanism: Steps taken since the adoption of resolution 72/6 include the realignment of the Regional Coordination Mechanism thematic working groups with the Sustainable Development Goals as well as the establishment of terms of reference and work plans for each thematic working group, which include outputs in support of least developed, land-locked and Pacific island developing countries, among other subregional groupings. The thematic working groups support knowledge-sharing and will be involved in tracking progress on the 2030 Agenda and coordinating support at the regional level. The seven, new thematic working groups are on resource efficient growth; sustainable societies; inclusive development and poverty eradication; disaster risk reduction and resilience; gender equality and the empowerment of women; education 2030+; and statistics. The thematic working groups have work plans for 2016-2017 which include joint outputs that will feed into the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development and its reporting to the high-level political forum on sustainable development. The thematic working groups will be positioning future work plans to align with the high-level political forum themes and the mandates of the Asia-Pacific regional road map. The Regional Coordination Mechanism has also cooperated in the negotiation and adoption of the ASEAN-United Nations Plan of Action for 2016-2020, which specifically supports ASEAN member States in identifying the complementarities between the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda.     In addition, a communications plan has been developed for the Regional Coordination Mechanism which included the launching of a new website in 2016 that provides comprehensive reporting and archiving of collaboration efforts among the United Nations agencies in Asia and the Pacific, including work that is produced by the Regional Coordination Mechanism thematic working groups.       iii. Analytical work focusing on Sustainable Development and SDGs:    Sustainable development- and SDGs-focused flagship publications and books to be delivered during the biennium 2018-2019 analyze challenges, means of implementation and progress made in the Asia-Pacific region in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs. New titles such as the thematic reports on Sustainable Development, Financing for Development in Asia and the Pacific, Social Outlook for Asia and the Pacific, and Asia-Pacific SDGs Indicators-based Progress Report are introduced to provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and situations of the three dimensions of sustainable development.     ESCAP's key SDG publications that were released in 2016-2017 included:    Eradicating Poverty and Promoting Prosperity in a Changing Asia-Pacific, available at: http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/publications/AP_SDG_Thematic-Report_2017.pdf     Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook 2017, available at:  http://www.unescap.org/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook     Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2017: Measuring SDG progress in Asia and the Pacific: Is there enough data?, available at: http://www.unescap.org/publications/statistical-yearbook-asia-and-pacific-2017     Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific 2016-SDG Baseline Report, available at: http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/ESCAP_SYB2016_SDG_baseline_report.pdf     iv. Capacity-building projects for member States focusing on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs:    Capacity-building projects for member States, in particular for least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, and small island developing States, focus mainly on enhancing their capacity in designing and implementing policies and programmes for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs with emphasis on financing for development, connectivity, technology and innovation, conduct of national follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda, social development, statistics and energy. Some of this work was supported through a Rapid Response Facility. The Rapid Response Facility provides quick and effective response to support countries in the implementation of the SDGs. In particular, identifying and addressing SDG data and statistics gaps (including visualization); supporting integrated systems analysis to help understand SDG interlinkages and identify policy priorities; supporting national follow up and review; facilitating stakeholder participation in SDG implementation, supporting trade facilitation, integration and LDC graduation. Other core areas including facilitating ICT for development (gender, youth etc), development of social polities etc. will also be considered.  ",

The standardization of the performance indicators for all subregions  aims at measuring deeper of ESCAP's support to member States in a given subregion in terms of (1) building capacity of planning and implementing coherent policies supporting the integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development; (2) adoption of policies in line with ESCAP recommendations; and (3) reaching consensus on regional and subregional dimensions of sustainable development.",
		"q2_4": "Leaving no one behind:    ESCAP, with its resolution 73/9 endorsed the Regional Road Map for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific. The Regional Road Map has, as one its thematic areas, \"leaving no one behind\" where the following opportunities for regional collaboration are identified:    (a) Promote analytical studies and policy advocacy to address inequalities, reduce poverty and enhance social protection, including for persons with disabilities, to build socioeconomic resilience;     (b) Continue regional and subregional dialogues to support multisectoral policies, strategies and programmes to implement the 2030 Agenda, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and advance gender equality and women's empowerment;     (c) Address unemployment and underemployment among youth, including by improving the match between the knowledge and skills of youth and labour market demands;     (d) Facilitate regional and subregional dialogue on policies to address population ageing;     (e) Implement the Incheon Strategy to \"Make the Right Real\" for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific;     (f) Strengthen the linkages between international migration and development, including through more effective management of migration.    As part of its work on leaving no one behind, ESCAP launched the flagship publication entitled Sustainable Social Development in Asia and the Pacific: Towards a People-Centred Transformation, which contains a summary of the social development gaps in the region and an outline of the key priorities and resources needed for a people-centred transformation in 2017. ESCAP also organized the Strategic Dialogue on Poverty and Inequality in Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok to identify the challenges faced by the region in measuring and addressing poverty and inequality and sharing good practices.     ESCAP published a policy paper series on inequality of opportunity, with four papers measuring inequality of access to education, employment, clean energy and health. The policy papers are accompanied by a guide on how to measure inequality of opportunity. A study on multidimensional inequality in Indonesia was prepared and discussed at the Indonesia Development Forum 2017. The study reviewed progress in key opportunities and highlighted persisting rural-urban disparities and an increasing gap in educational attainment between the richest and poorest quintiles.     As a part of its efforts to promote women's empowerment through entrepreneurship, ESCAP prepared a study entitled Fostering Women's Entrepreneurship in ASEAN: Transforming Prospects, Transforming Societies. ESCAP organized a regional forum on gender-responsive budgeting in Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok, resulting in increased momentum in the advocacy of the importance of gender-responsive budgeting and enhanced dialogue and partnerships around sustainable financing for achieving gender equality and the 2030 Agenda.     ESCAP prepared a report entitled Realizing Youth Inclusion for a More Sustainable Asia and the Pacific to broaden understanding of the multitude of institutional and sociocultural barriers that youth face in realizing their potential, and established a youth policy toolbox as an online repository of good practices and policies to assist Governments in developing policies for harnessing the potential of youth. The toolbox has been launched in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, the Philippines and six Pacific island countries. ESCAP also convened an Interregional Youth Policy Forum in Bangkok in cooperation with the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia and the Economic Commission for Africa to share good practices across the regions in facilitating the school-to-work transition of youth.     To enhance the evidence base for policy options, ESCAP prepared a report entitled Addressing the Challenges of Population Ageing in Asia and the Pacific: Implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, in which it argues that with effective policies, population ageing can herald a period of sustained progress. A special issue of the Asia-Pacific Population Journal (vol. 32, No. 1, August 2017) focused on population ageing, covering themes such as human resource requirements for meeting the needs of an ageing society; the availability and use of appropriate technology to enhance access by older persons to services, including health and long-term care services; and gender dimensions of ageing in the Asia-Pacific region. ESCAP convened the Asia-Pacific Intergovernmental Meeting on the Third Review and Appraisal of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing to accelerate the implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002, in order to foster an inclusive society for all ages.  ESCAP organized subregional capacity-building workshops on income security for older persons in the Pacific and in South Asia. The workshops focused on the design of policies for income security for older persons and the importance of providing sustainable systems of income security in ageing societies.     ESCAP produced a report entitled Building Disability-Inclusive Societies in Asia and the Pacific: Assessing Progress of the Incheon Strategy, a comprehensive regional progress report on the participation of persons with disabilities in development opportunities at the midpoint review of the implementation of the Incheon Strategy. ESCAP convened the High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Midpoint Review of the Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, 2013–2022, in Beijing in November 2017. The Meeting adopted the Beijing Declaration, including the Action Plan to Accelerate the Implementation of the Incheon Strategy, to foster disability-inclusive development through a comprehensive regional policy action plan involving Governments and other stakeholders over the subsequent five years.     ESCAP published a report entitled Towards Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in the Asia-Pacific Region: Challenges and Opportunities, in which it provides up-to-date information on migration trends, highlights key policy issues with respect to ensuring safe, orderly and regular migration in the Asia-Pacific region and provides recommendations to help guide discussions at the Asia-Pacific Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which was convened by ESCAP in cooperation with the International Organization for Migration and other United Nations agencies. The Meeting helped the region develop an Asia-Pacific perspective on safe, orderly and regular migration to feed into the global stocktaking meeting on the global compact on migration that was held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, from 4 to 6 December 2017. ESCAP also published four studies on the links between international migration and development in North and Central Asia.    ESCAP developed a series of online training tools to support policymakers in Asia and the Pacific in their efforts with respect to social protection, youth and disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction.     Under the Thematic Working Group on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, joint initiatives have been carried out including research and analysis, intergovernmental consensus-building and stakeholder engagement towards advancing gender equality in the Asia-Pacific region. Specifically, an analytical paper on financing for gender equality in Asia and the Pacific has been developed, which proposes key recommendations to enhance investment in women and girls to meet the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda. The Thematic Working Group has also undertaken joint advocacy efforts, including on prevention of violence against women and children. The outputs reported have supported progress towards targets and means of implementation 1.3, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.a, 5.b, 8.3, 8.5, 8.8, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.7 and 16.12 of the Sustainable Development Goal indicator framework.    Further, ESCAP has been working on sex-disaggregation breakdowns by relevant population groups with a view to improving the availability of disaggregated data for monitoring the SDGs.      Integrated policy approaches:    The ESCAP methodological tool on Integrated Approaches for Sustainable Development Goals Planning: The Case of Goal 6 on Water and Sanitation was published.    ESCAP supported the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals with the means of implementation of the New Urban Agenda under a new partnership with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), focusing on providing policy assistance in the areas of financing, data and partnerships with non-State actors. ESCAP co-chaired the United Nations Development Group Asia-Pacific Task Team on Urbanization, which promotes policy coherence on urban issues at both the regional and the country levels among 20 member-agencies.    ESCAP and UN-Habitat collaborated to support policy coherence in mainstreaming climate change responses, including the nationally determined contribution priorities of selected countries in the region, into current and forthcoming national urban policies.    The Asia-Pacific Research and Training Network on Trade Expert Group on Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals was established and nodal points as well as capacity-building needs were identified for Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Nepal. Policy advice was also provided to Afghanistan on trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.    ESCAP published Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2017: Channelling Trade and Investment into Sustainable Development, which focused on the means of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. A handbook on policies, promotion and facilitation of FDI for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific was published in October 2017. Good practice case studies, tools for evidence-based policymaking and the negotiation of agreements for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and publications relating to the negotiation of development-oriented preferential trade agreements, intellectual property rights and non-tariff barriers were issued, and online training materials were developed as contributions to existing courses.    Workshops and training on FDI promotion and facilitation were held in Myanmar and Uzbekistan. The annual meeting and capacity-building events were organized for the Asia-Pacific FDI Network for Least Developed and Landlocked Developing States, at which the linkages between FDI, innovation and the Sustainable Development Goals were also discussed. Regional and national workshops were organized on trade agreements with respect to graduation from least developed country status, and trade policies for  sustainable development.    The outputs reported have supported progress towards targets 1.1, 8.3, 8.10, 9.3, 10.1 and 17.16 of the Sustainable Development Goal indicator framework.  ",

		"q3_1": "ESCAP as a Regional Commission carries out normative/intergovernmental, research and analytical and capacity building functions. ESCAP's work programme is fully aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and guided by the Regional road map at the Asia-Pacific level.     ESCAP's Programme of Work 2018-2019 is available at:  https://undocs.org/en/A/72/6(Sect.19)    The Regional road map for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific is available at: http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/publications/SDGs-Regional-Roadmap.pdf     ESCAP in its work with countries takes as national development plans as a framework to operate in to be able to respond to the demands of member States and ensure policy coherence. The following are some examples of ESCAP's work on mainstreaming the SDGs in national planning through multisectoral and sectoral frameworks.    Multi-sectoral    ESCAP established a rapid response facility (RRF) to provide quick and effective response to countries in support of the different thematic areas and priority issues of the Regional Road Map. In 2017, missions were deployed to 10 countries in Asia and the Pacific (Bhutan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Samoa, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Lao PDR, Kiribati and Sri Lanka). RRF missions focused on a wide range of issues such as  strengthening national statistical systems including the identification and of addressing SDG data and statistics gaps (including visualization); supporting integrated systems analysis to help understand SDG interlinkages and identify policy priorities; supporting national follow up and review including through Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs); facilitating stakeholder participation in SDG implementation; and supporting trade facilitation, integration and LDC graduation.     In support of increasing the coherence and alignment of UN operational activities, RRF missions at the national level are implemented in the context of the work of UN Country Team (UNCTs). The RRF secretariat is requested to inform the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator (UNRC) of the intended scope of work of the mission, including details of the duration and purpose.     Target countries are those with limited capacities in data mapping, collection and visualization; those embarking on national planning processes that can benefit from integrated systems analysis; countries on the verge of LDC graduation; countries requiring support with convening the multiple stakeholders needed to implement, follow up and review the SDGs; countries undertaking VNRs; countries embarking on UNDAF process.    ESCAP has established a Sustainable Development Goals Help Desk (SDG Help Desk) to support policy makers from member States in the Asia-Pacific region with tools, methodologies and opportunities for sharing best practices on developing effective strategies, policies and institutional mechanisms for implementation of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the SDGs. The SDG Help Desk is designed to serve as the primary modality for coordinating ESCAP's support to member States in specific priority areas such as integration of the SDGs in national planning, stakeholder engagement, effective follow-up and review, and building partnerships for SDG implementation. The Help Desk will be launched at the fifth session of the Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development in 2018 and can be accessed at: https://sustdev.unescap.org/    Gender    ESCAP's work on building capacity and advocating for enabling legislative frameworks for women entrepreneurs to be able to reach their full potential, for policy interventions and investment to promote women's transformative leadership in the region and for promoting the integration of gender concerns into national planning and budgetary processes as well as the institutionalization of gender-responsive budgeting across Asia-Pacific, governments to harness e-government as a tool towards women's empowerment, has strengthened the application of gender-responsive budgeting in national contexts and enhanced dialogue and partnerships around sustainable financing for achieving gender equality and the 2030 Agenda. Governments in the region have committed to follow-up activities to fully integrate gender concerns into the national planning and budgetary processes, e.g. Lao People's Democratic Republic, Cambodia and China.    Environment    ESCAP launched a methodology that takes stock of the \"indivisible\" nature of the 2030 Agenda and the three dimensions of sustainable development—economic prosperity, social justice and environmental protection—and applies systems thinking approach to integration of the SDGs into national planning. Further illustrating the application of integrated and systems thinking approaches is a selection of case studies. Country case studies describe the applications in Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Fiji with SDG 6 on water and sanitation planning at the core. A case study on SDG 11 on sustainable urban development applies systems thinking principles including best practices from Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Thailand in relation to urban metabolism and natural resource efficiency. Regional case studies highlight emerging, persistent, and systemic issues, including microplastics, wastewater management, and gender-sensitive access to sanitation. The theme of the integrated approach will be featured on the SDG Help Desk through interactive methodologies, tools and various knowledge products to further assist member states in integrating the SDGs into national planning.    Through its work on Integrated Resource Recovery Center (IRRC) ESCAP supported developing countries in the region to achieve SDG 12 through integration of 3R principles (reduce, reuse, recycle) and resource efficiency in their national development plans (target 12.5).    Statistics    In 2016, member States and development partners in Asia and the Pacific agreed to the Collective Vision and Framework for Action by the Asia-Pacific Statistics Community to enable and empower national statistics systems to lead development and delivery of innovative, trusted and timely products and services for urgent and evolving statistical requirements of the 2030 Agenda. Consensus was established through a series of subregional and regional consultations organized by ESCAP, under the guidance of the Committee on Statistics.    Guided by this collective vision, regional initiatives in the areas of economic statistics, population and social statistics, civil registration and vital statistics, gender statistics, environment statistics, disaster-related statistics and modernization were adjusted and realigned to contribute directly to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. ESCAP statistical products and services, including the database and the statistical yearbook, provided critical insights on the baseline status and progress of SDG implementation for enhanced awareness of effective strategy and policy options for inclusive and sustainable development. These products also guided the development of statistical work plans and national strategies for development of statistics through improved understanding of the current data availability, gaps and capacity needs.

		"q3_2": "ESCAP's work on LDC graduation on SDGs    Macroeconomic policy    ESCAP, in collaboration with the Royal Government of Cambodia, co-organised a regional workshop, Strengthening Development of Least Developed Countries in Asia and the Pacific to Support Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,  to support the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action for LDCs, including its support for the smooth transition of LDCs graduation processes. The meeting was held in October 2017 in Cambodia, where 11 of the region's 12 LDCs participated. The workshop reviewed progress of LDCs in the region in implementing the Istanbul Programme of Action for LDCs, shared knowledge among policymakers and researchers on ways to effectively leverage development cooperation partnerships, and discussed ways to enhance regional economic cooperation and integration of LDCs, with a focus on CLM (Cambodia, Myanmar and Lao PDR) integration with other ASEAN countries.  For further information, please see http://www.unescap.org/events/csn-ldc-workhop-in-cambodia     ESCAP organized with the Royal Government of Bhutan a regional workshop on formulating national policies and strategies in preparation for graduation from the LDC category in Bhutan in 2017. The capacity building workshop provided opportunities for policymakers from Bhutan, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Myanmar to understand the usage and policy scenarios of macroeconomic models and tools to identify strategies and implement policies for LDCs post-graduation opportunities within the SDGs framework.  For further information, please see  http://www.unescap.org/events/csn-ldc-workshop-in-bhutan ESCAP has also provided advisory services for the development of a bond market in Bhutan.    There is a plan to organise a subregional workshop for the Pacific LDCs (i.e., Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu) to study how graduation can be made sustainable and beneficial to all segments of society as well as carrying out a cost benefit analysis of graduation and understanding the incentive structures. This will also provide a good opportunity to raise the issue of vulnerability and other forms of challenges within the context of these LDCs, which will also be aligned with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.    Under the Development Account Project, 11th tranche, there is a planned two-day capacity building workshop in Vanuatu during the fourth quarter of 2018 on formulating national policies and strategies in preparation for graduation, including the financing for development strategies.     Trade policy    As a part of its mandate and against the backdrop of slow growth in least developed countries, ESCAP has been providing tailor-made capacity-building and policy advice that support the Asia-Pacific economies in mainstreaming the SDGs in development plans. ESCAP organized a Regional workshop of least developed countries LDCs) on 2-4 August 2017 in Bhutan, where the policymakers and stakeholders discussed and identified their future capacity building needs. ARTNeT group of experts on Trade and SDGs was also established in this Bhutan workshop.     Tailor-made national capacity building programmes on challenges relating to trade-related issues with special focus on LDC graduation and market access were organized in Cambodia (August and October 2017), Lao PDR (May and July 2018) and Timor Leste (November 2017).  in collaboration with their Governments. The workshops also facilitated the dialogue between policy makers and stakeholders in identifying, by using an integrated approach, possible way forward for meeting the goals relating to Istanbul Programme of Action and SDGs. Advisory services were also provided to Cambodia (October 2017) and Timor Leste (November 2017) on meeting the challenges in trade and investment associated with least developed countries' graduation and to harness trade for implementation of SDGs.    To assist the Asia-Pacific least developed countries in improving their market access and improving exports, ESCAP conducted detailed studies of trade-related procedures in Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal to be used as baseline for the establishment of national trade and transport facilitation monitoring mechanism. ESCAP/ARTNeT also published studies on the role and impact of non-tariff measures focused on for Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar.    Several regional, subregional and national capacity building workshops were also organized to build capacity of least developed countries on trade policy issues, including on how to negotiate and formulate inclusive development-friendly preferential trade agreements and policy options to enhance and diversify markets. This included a Regional workshop for least developed countries and leveraging trade as a means of implementation for the 2030 Agenda (August 2017). ESCAP also assisted Myanmar to formulate its global safeguard rules to protect domestic producers from serious injury caused by increased imports.     As part of its support to least developed countries' in simplifying trade procedures and facilitating trade for sustainable development, ESCAP also organized capacity building sessions on the Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific in Cambodia (January 2017) and Bangladesh (March 2017), as well as Myanmar (September 2017). Bangladesh and Cambodia signed the UN treaty in August 2017.     Of the 12 ESCAP least developed country members, eight are now members of WTO.

Both institutes have contributed to SDG mainstreaming in sectoral strategies and policies. Some examples are as follows:    Regional Forum on Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization in Asia and the Pacific    The Regional Forum on Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization in Asia and the Pacific is a strategic annual event of CSAM for high-level policy dialogue and regional cooperation towards integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development into policies, strategies and frameworks of sustainable agriculture/agricultural mechanization in Member Countries. It also plays a role as an incubator of ideas for guiding CSAM's new activities since it was initiated in 2013.     The 4th Regional Forum on Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization in Asia and the Pacific was held in Hanoi, Viet Nam on 23-25 November 2016. Focusing on the theme of \"Leading the Way for Climate-Smart Agriculture through Machinery and Practices\", the Forum focused on how low-carbon technologies and innovative practices available across the Asia-Pacific region are distributed and applied, including conservation agriculture, biochar, direct rice seeding, straw management, and so forth. Meanwhile, a panel discussion on \"How can mechanization contribute better to climate-smart agriculture?\" was conducted and concluded that agricultural mechanization can play a positive role in achieving climate-smart agriculture in the realms of both adaptation and mitigation.    CSAM organized the 5th Regional Forum on Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization in Asia and the Pacific on the theme of ‘Promoting Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization Strategy' (SAMS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Agricultural Development of Nepal on 12-14 December 2017 in Kathmandu, Nepal. The Forum facilitated discussion on national policy formulation, strategy development, and identification of innovative solutions for sustainable agricultural mechanization. The Forum successfully reached out to around 50 agricultural mechanization officials and experts from 16 countries and other pertinent stakeholders.    CAPSA's work on climate-resilient agriculture focused on taking local plans as the framework.  The main outputs of this work were a Training Manual on ‘Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) to Support Local Planning for Climate-resilient Agriculture' (translated into Burmese, December 2016) and 3 provincial Workshops on ‘Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) to Support Local Planning for Climate-resilient Agriculture' in September 2016.    In collaboration with the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific (SIAP), CAPSA also organized a Policy Analysis Workshop: ‘Transition towards Sustainable Agriculture in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – Strategic Implementation, Follow Up and Review', in November 2016 in Bogor, Indonesia.  ",
		"q3_3": "Normative work for SDGs    ESCAP supported SDG data and statistics through substantive inputs and facilitation of the formulation of a collective vision and framework for multi-stakeholder action in the Asia-Pacific region to transform official statistics for the SDGs. This was achieved through organizing a regional conference for consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, as well as a series of sub-regional events for further inputs. The resulting ‘collective vision and framework for action by the Asia-Pacific statistical community', which particularly emphasizes related capacity strengthening, was also consulted with the Governing Council of SIAP at its 12th session, and subsequently endorsed by the Committee on Statistics at its fifth session in December 2016. In March 2017, a regional conference was conducted to discuss with a mix of senior officials and experts, regional strategies for successful implementation of the collective vision and for developing and implementing national comprehensive indicator frameworks.     ESCAP has further aligned its work in all domains of statistics with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.     1. Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)    The Regional Action Framework (RAF) on Civil   Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) in Asia and the Pacific sets the framework for the regional initiative to ‘Get Every One in the Picture' during the Asia Pacific CRVS Decade (2015-2024). As part of the reporting structure of the RAF, 38 members and associate members have submitted baseline report to the ESCAP Secretariat by the end of 2017. Information on national targets and baseline data was made available on www.getinthepicture.org and fed into a regional synthesis report which was presented to the 72nd Commission session in May 2016. The key findings were condensed into an advocacy brochure labelled ‘CRVS Decade in Asia and the Pacific -The situation at the beginning of the CRVS Decade'. ESCAP continued to advocate for the \"Get Every One in the Picture' initiative by regular dissemination of news on CRVS, advocacy materials developed in collaboration with partners as well as continuous improvements to the regional platform for CRVS www.getinthepicture.org. In addition to the regular dissemination efforts, a side event to the Fourth Asia Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development was held in March 2017. The event focused on the importance of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) to eradicate poverty in Asia and the Pacific was held together with UNHCR, Secretariat for the Pacific Community (SPC), World Vision and the Thai Health Information Standards Development Centre in the Ministry of Public Health.     The second and third meeting of the Regional Steering Group on Asia and the Pacific was convened in September 2016 and October 2017. The second meeting reviewed the achievements and main challenges from the baseline and national target reports from 37 countries (submitted at the time) on the implementation of the Regional Action Framework on Civil Registration and Vital Statistics in Asia and the Pacific, and made recommendations to governments and development partners to maintain the momentum and accelerate progress by leveraging the emphasis on the SDGs. The Third meeting focused on the preparations for the mid-term review of the CRVS Decade in 2019 as well as on establishing task forces to develop materials in a range of technical areas related to CRVS. The Regional Steering Group further reviewed guidance notes for countries on the link between CRVS and electoral registrars, how to establish CRVS Coordination mechanisms and develop national CRVS strategies.        2. Economic statistics    ESCAP's economic statistics work is organized within the framework of the Regional Programme for the improvement of Economic Statistics (RPES) which was endorsed by the member States at the second session of the Committee on Statistics in 2010. The substantive scope of the Programme is delineated by the Core Set of Economic Statistics which was endorsed by the Commission in resolution 67/10. The regional coordination of the Programme is led by the Steering Group comprising member countries (NSO and Central Bank representatives), development partners and ESCAP Statistics Division as ESCAP. The Steering Group meets yearly as part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Statistics Week to review the implementation of the Regional Programme.    Four Steering Group Task Forces were formed in 2016 to work on: (i) Capacity Screening 2017; (ii) Asia-Pacific Economic Statistics Week 2017; (iii) Quality Assurance Frameworks for Economic Statistics; and (iv) Statistical Business Registers. The members of these task forces are ESCAP, development partners and countries. The Capacity Screening is a survey conducted in accordance with the milestones of the Regional Programme across the national statistical systems of the region to monitor the implementation of the Regional Programme for the improvement of Economic Statistics.    3. Population and social statistics    The implementation plan of the Regional Strategy to Improve Population and Social Statistics in Asia and the Pacific under the guidance of a Friends of the Chair Group reflects the reformulation of the goals and targets and priority areas for regional collaboration, in alignment with the regional collective vision and framework for action by the Asian-Pacific statistical community to transform national statistical systems to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The implementation plan was endorsed by the Committee on Statistics at its 5th session in December 2016. Tasked by the Committee on Statistics, ESCAP also established a Regional Steering Group (RSG) on population and social statistics to provide directions and guide implementation of the Regional Strategy. The first meeting of RSG was held in August 2017.    4. Disaster statistics    In 2014, ESCAP adopted resolution 70/2, on Disaster-related Statistics, which established an expert group involving statisticians and experts on disaster management. During 2016 and 2017, the Expert Group conducted a series of pilot studies and consultations with expert group members and developed a disaster-related statistics framework (DRSF) and guidelines for implementation, including the specifications for a basic range of disaster-related statistics, as a resource for members states for improving disaster-related statistics. DRSF provides a key reference for harmonization and improved comparability of data that are used to produce indicators for the international monitoring frameworks (SDGs and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction). The final draft DRSF and guidelines, is the main and final output from this Expert Group. Although it was developed under a regional mandate, the group received feedback that the output has relevance and value added globally. The DRSF will undergo further review, internationally, during 2018 and the Expert Group will submit its final report to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in May 2018. Future work by ESCAP in this domain is expected to focus on providing further support to national institutions with implementation of the new framework.     Data and analytical work for SDGs    The ESCAP Statistical database contains time series data for over 400 statistical indicators on development issues, including Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators for which data are currently available. Data are disseminated online and through various ESCAP reports, mainly through the Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific.    In 2016, the Statistical Division initiated the re-development of its statistical information system to improve user interface and enhance dissemination. The re-structuring of the core statistical database also increased flexibility and use by allowing multiple indicators frameworks such as the SDGs and to disseminate data through a range of data products. The statistical database, including the newly added SDG indicators, served as basis for the preparation of the SDG baseline report component of the Statistical Yearbook 2016 with data extracted from the database and shared with the team of experts to draft analytical inputs to be prepared. A new aggregation was also developed as part of the system to make more regional aggregates available based on limited country data. A set of tools (SQL queries, pivot tables) and procedures have been developed to prepare tables on data availability for SDG indicators.    The 2016 edition of the Statistical Yearbook was devoted to assessing the baseline status of the region and the sub-regions against Agenda 2030 goals and targets. The report was launched on 10 July 2017 during the High-Level Political Forum, in New York. It consists of three different parts namely, regional snapshot, goal-by-goal progress assessment, and conclusions. The report establishes a baseline, assesses regional progress since 2000 and identifies the gaps which need to be closed if the SDGs are to be achieved by 2030.    The 2017 edition of the Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific is structured around 3 core components: (1) the online databases (ESCAP and SDG subset); (2) Country SDG datasheets; and (3) a review of SDG data availability in the Asia-Pacific region.     Technical assistance and capacity building for SDGs    ESCAP initiated and tested a consolidated approach to SDG implementation in Mongolia (October 2017) and Pakistan (November 2017). The approach combines ESCAP's systems approach to assessing SDG linkages and stakeholder engagement with its approaches to benchmarking progress on the SDGs and a Diagnostic Tool for developing statistical work plans.    ESCAP's technical assistance and capacity building in sectoral statistics has been aligned with the 2030 Agenda and monitoring requirements of the SDGs. ESCAP has programmes in the following domains of statistics:    1. Civil Registration and vital statistics (CRVS)  The Project to Strengthen the National Capacity in Producing and Disseminating Vital Statistics from Civil Registration Records in Asia and the Pacific (December 2016 to December 2017) was implemented with funding from the Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative and will be followed up by a second phase in 2018-2019. The Project included two sequential training workshops for 8 countries in Asia, as well as the follow-up technical guidance to project countries to help process and analyze data from civil registration records, leading to the drafting and completion of national vital statistics reports. The workshops used the Draft Guidelines and Template for Developing a Vital Statistics Report developed by Statistics Norway in collaboration with ESCAP and ECA. The Project also supported the development of the second version of the guidelines for setting and monitoring the goals and targets of the Regional Action Framework on CRVS in Asia and the Pacific as well as missions to Bhutan, Mongolia and Viet Nam to advise the national CRVS focal points and other relevant stakeholders on implementation of the Regional Action Framework.     ESCAP, as a member of the Brisbane Accord Group (also including UNICEF, UNFPA, SPC, WHO, Universities and the Pacific Civil Registrar's Network) on CRVS in the Pacific (BAG), collaborated with ESCAP of the Pacific Community and other BAG members to conduct a training workshop on data analysis and report writing for civil registration data and vital statistics. The BAG and ESCAP also co-organised a workshop for small Pacific island states to share experiences and identify ways forward to improve national CRVS systems in March 2017. In October 2017, ESCAP collaborated with BAG partners on a workshop on Disaster Preparation and Response for 20 members of the Pacific Civil Registrars Network leading to improved planning for disasters by civil registrars in the Pacific.     National grants were disbursed to 5 countries and a regional workshop on outcomes and lessons learnt from these technical assistance projects was held in April 2016. The workshop included training on how to establish a national coordination mechanism and develop national strategies for CRVS.     In December 2017, ESCAP organized a workshop for national CRVS focal points from 11 countries, focusing on developing national CRVS strategies and setting up national CRVS coordination mechanisms.     2. Economic statistics    The economic statistics activities of ESCAP Statistics Division have focused further on analytical capacity building and engagement of member States in the delivery of regional knowledge products such as national studies and reports as part of the outputs of the newly established Steering Group task forces. Papers that were presented at the Asia-Pacific Economic Statistics Week 2016 and 2017 are available on the ESCAP Communities website as a resource and the report of the Week has identified priority issues for improving the quality of economic statistics were discussed.    As a result of the economic statistics, regional project support meetings and country-level economic statistics technical assistance were delivered for Cambodia, Lao PDR, Maldives and Viet Nam, planned for Bhutan and Sri Lanka. Draft proposals for national studies were also produced for 8 countries. The national studies by Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan and Vietnam were also developed in preparation for and during project support meetings.    3.

Environment statistics    The capacity building work of the Statistics Division in environment statistics focused on supporting countries in the initiation and improvement of their environment statistics programmes in response to demands arising from the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to support policy decisions in achieving national development priorities.    In 2016, the Division initiated a series of sub-regional workshops on environment statistics to strengthen capacity of National Statistical Systems on basic approaches to environment statistics, including the Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics (FDES) and the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), and strategic planning for improving environment statistics. Sub-regional workshops were held for the Pacific countries (September 2016), South-East Asian countries (November 2016), South and South-West Asian countries (February 2017), East and North-East Asian countries (March 2017) and North and Central Asian countries (November 2017).    The Division continued the implementation of the United Nations Development Account project entitled \"Strengthening Statistical Capacities for Building Macroeconomic and Sustainable Development Indicators in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific countries\". A letter of agreement was signed between ESCAP and the Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal to support its first compilation of land and forest accounts. ESCAP reviewed Nepal's pilot land accounts and the work plan for the forest account (May 2017). Assessment/training/work-planning missions were conducted in the Maldives (May 2016) and in Vanuatu (October 2016). Vanuatu released the assessment report and workplan (February 2017) and initiated pilot land accounts. In collaboration with the ESCAP's subregional office for the Pacific, energy accounts were piloted with the Federated States of Micronesia (May 2017).    In collaboration with Environment and Development Division, a project on improving the sustainable use of oceans (SDG 14) was initiated. This will address both ocean governance (coherence and comprehensiveness of policies and institutions) and data and statistics (ocean accounts). A concept note was developed on this approach and a scoping report was completed for Indonesia.    Technical advisory services, including hands-on training sessions, were provided to many countries in the region to strengthen environment statistics in accordance with FDES and SEEA:    • Technical assistance and training on SEEA in Fiji on Water, Energy and Waste Accounts in collaboration with United Nations Statistics Division in September 2016; the accounts were finalized in February 2017;    • Assessment and training mission to Malaysia in collaboration with United Nations Statistics Division (focus on Water) in September 2016;    • Scoping mission to Myanmar Central Statistical Organization in collaboration with the World Wildlife Foundation to assess priorities and capacity for strengthening environment statistics in November 2016; a work plan and inventory of relevant forest statistics was initiated in February 2017; A technical advisory mission to inventory and compile data for pilot forest accounts was conducted in August 2017;    • Training/work planning mission to BPS Statistics Indonesia in preparation for pilot ecosystem, energy, material flows, land and water accounts in March 2017; Training on FDES was provided in July 2017;    • Assessment, training and work planning mission to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with UNEP/UNDP Poverty Environment Initiative (PEI) to assess data availability, conduct training and work planning in support of a pilot project linking environment and poverty in May 2017;    • Technical assistance to Thailand National Statistical Office in support of the preparation of a Natural Resources and Environment Statistics Development Plan in Q2 2017;     • An FDES stakeholder training workshop in the Philippines in collaboration with the Philippines Statistical Authority (PSA) in June 2017;    • An Regional Expert Workshop on Land Accounting for SDG Monitoring and Reporting was convened in Bangkok in September 2017. This brought together countries at various stages of implementing their SEEA land accounts. Participants benefited from sharing technical and institutional solutions as well as discussions with other agencies on opportunities for collaboration;    • In collaboration with UN Environment, a training/work planning mission was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan October 2017). This resulted in initiating work on land and water accounting. As well, advice was provided on establishing an environment statistics unit in the NSO and on creating an environmental data center; and    • SD, jointly with SIAP, conducted a week-long Regional Training Course on Climate Change-Related Statistics (Chiba, Japan, November 2017). This brought together existing SEEA and FDES modules (e.g., energy, air emissions, water, land) adapted to the needs for monitoring climate change drivers, impacts, mitigation and adaptation.    6. Modernizations of statistical information systems    ESCAP, in collaboration with The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data organized an event in April 2016 to help address the challenge of data revolution for 2030 Agenda by presenting the aims and functions of the Global Partnership to participants at the Asia Pacific Forum for Sustainable Development in April 2016. The Global Partnership aims to sustain political attention, connecting people, institutions and initiatives, build trust around data sharing, and bring people together to solve problems related to data capacity, gaps, access and use. ESCAP is a member of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data.    ESCAP held the Forum on Innovative Data Methods for SDGs in May 2017 in Incheon, Republic of Korea. The meeting brought together key innovators in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence, remote sensing and satellite imagery, the use of unstructured data for the construction of knowledge graphs and other types of data linking, crowdsourcing algorithms for social good, and open algorithms and secure computational platforms, among others. The SD portion of the meeting focused on the role that modern analytical methods, analytical infrastructure, and data management approaches can have in the region's developing economies. The meeting concluded by establishing a need for a regional data science collaboration platform, to enable knowledge sharing, training, and scaling-up and validating new research methods within country contexts. The proposed platform became known as the \"SDG Data Hub.\"    In summary, ESCAP's work on statistics has contributed to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs in the following ways:    SDG 17: In 2016, Member States and development partners agreed to the Collective Vision and Framework for Action by the Asia-Pacific Statistics Community to enable and empower national statistics systems to lead development and delivery of innovative, trusted and timely products and services for urgent and evolving statistical requirements of Agenda 2030. Consensus was established through a series of subregional and regional consultations organized by ESCAP, under the guidance of the Committee on Statistics.    Guided by this collective vision, regional initiatives in the areas of economic statistics, population and social statistics, civil registration and vital statistics, gender statistics, environment statistics, disaster-related statistics and modernization were adjusted and realigned to contribute directly to the 2030 Agenda. ESCAP statistical products and services, including the database and statistical yearbook, provided critical insights on the baseline status and progress of SDG implementation for enhanced awareness of effective strategy and policy options for inclusive and sustainable development. These products also guided the development of statistical work plans and national strategies for development of statistics through improved understanding of the current data availability, gaps and capacity needs.    SDG 16: The Asia Pacific CRVS Decade from 2015 to 2024 supports enhanced registration of vital events including birth registration (SDG 16.9). 38 Asia-Pacific countries have submitted national targets and baseline reports as part of the requirements of the Regional Action Framework on CRVS in Asia and the Pacific; at least 30 countries have set up national CRVS coordination mechanisms; and at least 15 countries have developed national CRVS strategies with 14 more countries are currently in the process of developing strategies. The progress in the implementation of the Regional Action Framework and the broader strengthening of national CRVS systems demonstrated the effectiveness of regional consensus and coordination for national action.

		"q3_4": "According to ESCAP's conference structure, there is one unified committee on Information and communications technology and Science, technology and innovation. However, the work programmes on information and communications technology and, science, technology and innovation fall under 2 separate subprogrammes. Therefore information on normative, analytical and technical cooperation work will be provided as they relate to the separate work programmes.    Information and communications technology work is implemented in close coordination with work on disaster risk reduction and management in ESCAP. Disasters in Asia-Pacific are becoming increasingly complex, tending to affect multiple countries, and bringing about cascading socio-economic impacts. In addition, despite the considerable progress made in using modern technology applications by some advanced economies in the region, the nature and scope of the growing digital divide in information and communications technology (ICT) and in the operational use of space applications remain challenges for the region. This disparity is exacerbating gaps in access to innovative technologies for disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. Given the interconnected nature of ICT, space applications and disaster risk reduction, supporting member States through strengthened regional cooperation in these areas should be considered as a matter of urgent priority.     Opportunities exist in strengthening regional cooperation. Until recently, innovations in ICT, space applications and disaster risk reduction and management were expensive and inaccessible to many countries in the Asia-Pacific region. However, over the past several years, the cost of access to innovative technologies and their applications has been reduced significantly. Spurred on by this digital revolution and intensifying extreme and transboundary weather events, countries have recognized common opportunities and challenges. The need to develop regional approaches in seamless ICT connectivity, using space technology and its applications, sharing of geospatial information, disaster information management and risk reduction has moved up in the policy-setting agenda of the region.    Normative work    The Asia-Pacific Information Superhighway initiative, which directly contributes to the achievement of SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure, aims to increase the availability and affordability of broadband Internet across Asia and the Pacific, by strengthening the underlying Internet infrastructure in the region. The initiative, administered by ESCAP, encompasses regional Internet maps and policy analysis to support countries in their efforts to develop a regional seamless information and communication space. The set of Internet maps developed by ESCAP and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) feature terrestrial Internet infrastructure, including optical fiber and wireless networks, as well as the various segments of the Asian Highway and Trans-Asian Railway. This multi-sectoral mapping tool allows policymakers to identify weak points in terrestrial broadband infrastructure, as well as opportunities for cross-sectoral infrastructure development.    Member States endorsed the AP-IS Master Plan and the Regional Cooperation Framework Document, at the Commission Session in 2017, through the adoption of resolution 73/6 entitled the Implementation of the AP-IS through Regional Cooperation. In addition, 87 external events, media coverages and other stakeholder interests mentioned the AP-IS initiative. Furthermore, the Government of Bangladesh financed the 1st session of the AP-IS Steering Committee in Dhaka in November 2017. It also proposed an amendment to the Agreement on the Asian Highway for ICT infrastructure co-deployment, and a working group discussed this further in December 2017.     Under the ESCAP-led Regional Drought Mechanism, officials from four member States benefitted from training on GIS and remote sensing with support from the Regional Service Nodes in China and India, respectively. Five member States expressed, through letters, their appreciation for ESCAP support on skill and institutional development on setting up and operating geo-portals, geo-database and geospatial data management for multi-hazard warning systems in the Pacific region. In addition, a declaration was adopted by the space leaders at the Asia-Pacific Space Leaders' Forum on Applications of Space Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction in New Delhi held in November 2016 and the vision and mission for the Asia-Pacific Plan of Action for Space Applications (2018-2030) was agreed at 21th session of the Intergovernmental Consultative Committee (ICC) on the Regional Space Application Programme for Sustainable Development (RESAP) held in October 2017.     Analytical work for SDGs    To improve knowledge and awareness of member States for effective strategies and policy options, the key publications, among others, included the following:     • State of ICT in Asia and the Pacific 2016;  • Artificial Intelligence and Broadband Divide: State of ICT Connectivity in Asia and the Pacific 2017; and   • Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2017: Leave No One Behind – Disaster Resilience for Sustainable Development.     In addition, to foster regional knowledge sharing the following papers and reports were developed:    • Disasters in Asia and the Pacific: 2015 Year in Review;   • Building a Resilient Digital Economy: Fostering SMEs in Central Asia;   • Promoting Investment in the Asia-Pacific Information Superhighway;   • The Impact of Universal Service Funds on Fixed-Broadband Deployment and Internet Adoption in Asia and the Pacific;  • A Study of ICT Connectivity for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): Enhancing the Collaboration in China-Central Asia Corridor;   • Planning processes, policies and initiatives in ICTD education at institutions of higher learning (IHLs) in Asia and the Pacific;   • Updated Analysis of the Broadband Infrastructure in Asia Pacific;   • A Pre-Feasibility Study on the Asia-Pacific Information Superhighway in the ASEAN Sub-region;   • Towards a new Asia-Pacific strategy using space applications to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: an opportunity for the space community to shape a sustainable future;  • ASEAN-ESCAP study on drought in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam; and  • Summary Response Survey 2017 (of RESAP).    Utilizing these knowledge products as the basis to build capacities of member States the following events were organized:    • Building Regional Tsunami Awareness (May 2016);  • First Pacific Regional Workshop on Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment and Early Warning Systems with Applications of Space and Geographic Information systems (September 2016);   • Regional Workshop on Resilient ICT Connectivity for the Knowledge Economy, SDGs and the WSIS Goals (September 2016);  • Eighth session of the SPECA Thematic Working Group on Knowledge-based Development (September 2016);   • Asia-Pacific Regional Internet and Development Dialogue (October 2016);   • Meeting on the Regional Review of the World Summit on the Information Society Acton Line Implementation (October 2016);   • 20th Meeting of the Regional Interagency Working Group on Information and Communication Technology (November 2016);   • Intensive one-month training on national geo portal and geo database for disaster risk reduction and sustainable development (February/March 2017);   • Building resilience to water-related disaster risks: the case for regional cooperation (May 2017);  • First Expert Group Meeting for development of a Pacific strategy on regional knowledge hubs for early warning systems (June 2017);   • First session of the Asia-Pacific Information Superhighway (AP-IS) Steering Committee (November, 2017);   • Twenty-First Meeting of the Regional Interagency Working Group on Information and Communication Technology (December 2017); and   • AP-IS Steering Group Meeting (December 2017).     Gender dimensions of strategies and policies were addressed in many events organized during the biennium. In particular, Mainstreaming Gender in Internet and Development in the Asia-Pacific Region was organized, jointly with the Internet Society (ISOC), in Bangkok, Thailand in October 2016. Furthermore, 5 country-level reports on Planning processes, policies and initiatives in ICTD education at institutions of higher learning (IHLs) in Asia and the Pacific were published which specifically examined gender disparity in ICTD education in IHLs in selected countries.     The ICT and DRR Gateway, an online platform for sharing knowledge and information was also updated with new features.    Technical assistance and capacity building for SDGs    Through its Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information and Communication Technology for Development (APCICT) located in Incheon, Republic of Korea, ESCAP has continued to strengthen its work of building the human and institutional capacities of member States on using ICT for sustainable development through its flagship capacity building programmes. In response to the need to support women and women entrepreneurs on ICT access and usage, APCICT launched in June 2016 the Women ICT Frontier Initiative (WIFI). WIFI aims to strengthen the capacity of women entrepreneurs in the region to utilize ICT in support of their business as well as strengthen capacity of government leaders to create an enabling environment for ICT-empowered women entrepreneurs.  APCICT's work over 2016-2017 contributed to the SDGs in the following ways:    SDG 4:  APCICT sensitized the youth on the enabling role of ICT in sustainable development by strengthening the coverage of ICTD in higher education.  The Centre promoted the \"Engaged Learning\" initiative that links ICTD classroom learning with community development among institutions of higher learning in Asia and the Pacific.    SDG 5: APCICT enhanced gender-related knowledge and strengthened policy skills of policymakers in support of ICT-empowered women entrepreneurs. APCICT also directly supported   women entrepreneurs through skill development in ICT-enabled planning, managing and expanding their businesses.    SDG 16: APCICT's Academy programme contributed to the creation of effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, sound policies and good governance at all levels. In strengthening the ICT capacities of civil servants, the Academy supported the enhancement of public service delivery, transparency and accountability, and citizen engagement. Ultimately, this also strengthened the capacities of member States to develop and implement strategies and programmes that would enable them to achieve the other SDG goals and targets.    Science, technology and innovation work is conducted in close coordination with work on Trade and Investment at ESCAP.    Normative work SDGs    Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Advisory Board of the Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Executive Secretary of ESCAP was set up and held its first two meetings (7 March 2016 and 3-4 October 2016), providing advice on issues, challenges and opportunities for STI in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals; and how ESCAP can best support regional STI collaboration and cooperation.     The first session of the Committee on Information and Communications Technology, Science, Technology and Innovation, was held in Bangkok on 5-7 October 2016, discussing how to best to share best practices and on facilitating knowledge-sharing and collective action through the possible establishment of an Asia-Pacific innovation forum, and ways of facilitating knowledge-sharing between the various subregional science, technology and innovation cooperation mechanisms (http://www.unescap.org/events/committee-information-and-communications-technology-science-technology-and-innovation-first).      In addition, to link regional expertise and needs to global United Nations STI initiatives, ESCAP convened panels at the Comprehensive High-level Midterm Review of the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020 in Antalya, Turkey in May 2016 and at the Third Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development in Bangkok in March 2017, that included regional members of the High-level Panel on Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries and the 10 Member Group to support the Technology Facilitation Mechanism.    Analytical work for SDGs    A theme study on Harnessing Science, Technology and Innovation for Inclusive and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific (http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/STI_Theme_Study.pdf) was produced for the 72nd Commission session.

Projects:    Localizing SDGs: Sustainable Resource Management (Development Account Project- beginning 2018)    This ESCAP-led project is expected to start implementation in March/April 2018 for 4 years.  With UN Habitat as a partner, the project aims to conceptualize and operationalize \"localizing\" (or integrating) the SDGs into urban development planning, implementation and evaluation in up to six cities in the region. It will focus on two key areas:  i) Development of a process to localize SDG planning by promoting inclusive, participatory and systemic approaches; and ii)  Development of substantive areas for cities to localize SDGs for the thematic sub-set on sustainable resource management (consisting of SDGs 6 clean water and sanitation; 7 affordable and clean energy, 11 sustainable cities and communities, 12 responsible consumption and production and 17 partnerships), taking into account local contexts. ESCAP will lead overall project coordination and organize regional-level activities, and will be responsible for developing conceptual frameworks and technical information and training materials – with substantive support from UN Habitat.    Urban Nexus: Sustainable Resource Management    In partnership with GIZ and ICLEI, ESCAP has been implementing the project \"Integrated Resource Management in Asian Cities: the Urban Nexus\" since 2013. The project will end in December 2018. The nexus approach aims to sustainably manage the critical resources of water, energy and food/land through an integrated and participatory approach that promotes innovative technologies and decentralized cross-sectoral infrastructure within the framework of a circular economy (return/reuse/recycle/recover). ESCAP, as the ‘political' partner, coordinates regional work – such as holding regional policy dialogues –and seeks to mainstream the nexus approach into national and local strategies for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the New Urban Agenda. GIZ is the lead executing agency and ‘technical' partner. ICLEI works with partner cities to implement nexus initiatives on the ground. The project supports twelve cities in China, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam.     Mainstreaming Climate Change Concerns into National Urban Policies    Since 2014, in partnership with UN Habitat, the project has been looking at how to mainstream climate change at the national policy or framework strategy level. The project work will continue throughout 2018.  UN Habitat is the project lead, while ESCAP leads regional coordination and regional comparative analysis work – namely convening regional workshops and currently the development of a regional guide that takes country-level experiences and tries to abstract lessons learned to a regional level. Based on that guide, ESCAP will lead the development of training materials. UN Habitat has been the main implementer of the project doing the country level work, backstopping analysis and actual support for mainstreaming into national urban policies/ strategic frameworks.  This project is related primarily to SDGs 11 and 13, and seeks to integrate sub-national actions and national government coordination.     Publications and Knowledge Platforms    The State of Asia Pacific Cities Report:    The State of Asian and Pacific Cities report has previously been jointly developed and published by UN-Habitat and ESCAP. So far there have been 2 editions: 2011 and 2015. In capturing the region's rapid urban transformation, the report highlights the growing gaps between current urbanization patterns and what is needed to shift to a more inclusive and sustainable urban future, in which the region's cities are unquestionably tied to national, regional and global development prospects. The Report also draws upon the most recent urban data from The World Urbanization Prospects.   The next report in 2019 will be rebranded the Future of Asia Pacific Cities Report, and will take into account the localization of SDGs in the region.    Urban SDG Knowledge Platform:    ESCAP, the Seoul Metropolitan Government and CityNet have established the Urban SDG Knowledge Platform http://www.urbansdgplatform.org/ to promote and support knowledge sharing and city-to-city cooperation for sustainable urban development. The Platform supports local action for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the up-take and replication of successful initiatives and good practices, by (i) providing a repository of policies, initiatives and good practices at the city level by municipal governments and other stakeholders; (ii) facilitating north-south, south-south, and triangular cooperation by linking cities that have developed specific policies, initiatives and good practices with other cities interested in learning from and replicating them; and, (iii) facilitating regional follow-up and review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development through a platform for local governments to share progress and lessons learned.      The SDG Help Desk     ESCAP has developed the SDG Help Desk, as a one-stop online platform which serves as a gateway to SDG data portals; knowledge and analytical products; expertise, advice and opportunities for peer learning and regional South-South cooperation; and toolboxes.  Sustainable urbanization is one of the thematic areas in the knowledge hub, and will be populated with best practices and lessons from projects (ESCAP and others) which aim to localize SDGs.    https://sustdev.unescap.org/thematicarea/category?id=4  ",

Further illustrating the application of integrated and systems thinking approaches is a selection of case studies. Country case studies describe the applications in Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Fiji with SDG 6 on water and sanitation planning at the core. A case study on SDG 11 on sustainable urban development applies systems thinking principles including best practices from Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Thailand in relation to urban metabolism and natural resource efficiency. Regional case studies highlight emerging, persistent, and systemic issues, including microplastics, wastewater management, and gender-sensitive access to sanitation. The theme of the integrated approach will be featured on ESCAP's SDG Help Desk through interactive methodologies, tools and various knowledge products to further assist member States in integrating the SDGs into national planning.    The Seoul Initiative Network on Green Growth (SINGG) project has supported enhancing understanding of member states in interlinkages between the cluster of SDGs and showcased integrated approaches to support sustainable use of environmental resources. The project raised awareness of member States with a holistic perspective on environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainable development, especially focusing on integrated approaches to environment-related SDGs. The SINGG will continue working with member States regarding follow-up projects in Indonesia and Mongolia to support their implementation of integrated approaches to SDGs.  ",

Following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs, efforts have been made to enhance policy coherence and coordination among UN agencies and development partners through the reformulation of the Regional Coordination Mechanism thematic working groups. New thematic working groups have been established in seven areas, which correspond to the relevant clusters of the Sustainable Development Goals. These thematic working groups include: (a) statistics; (b) resource-efficient growth; (c) sustainable societies; (d) inclusive development, including poverty eradication; (e) disaster risk reduction and resilience; (f) gender equality and empowerment of women; and (g) education for all.  The newly established thematic working groups have adopted their terms of reference and action-oriented work plans for the period of 2016-2017 to support coherent regional implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.     During 2016-2017, the Thematic Working Groups have jointly launched projects on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Some of the achievements resulted from collaboration are highlighted below:    (a) Under the Thematic Working Group on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, a multi-donor trust fund has been established under which the thematic working group members pool financial resources for the implementation of jointly agreed activities. Joint initiatives carried out with support from the Trust Fund include research and analysis, inter-governmental consensus building, and stakeholder engagement towards advancing gender equality in the Asia-Pacific region.  Notably, the Thematic Working Group provided inter-agency support to the organization of special sessions and side events during the Asian and Pacific Conference on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment: Beijing+20 Review (17-20 November 2014) to focus attention on critical gender concerns (such as women's economic participation, violence against women; women, peace and security), and the Conference resulted in a Ministerial Declaration to accelerate the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. The TWG has also undertaken joint advocacy including on prevention of violence against women and children.    (b) The Thematic Working Group on Sustainable Societies has worked together with the Thematic Working Group on Statistics and the Statistics Division, New York, on strengthening the collection and use of international migration data in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for countries in the region, including through a regional workshop organized in 2017.    (c) At the Asia-Pacific Forum for Sustainable Development (APFSD) in March 2017 – the region's preparatory meeting for the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July 2017, the Thematic Working Group on Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience presented its joint work on developing a guidance note for policymakers that outlines the coherence among the global agendas for building resilience to disasters in the region.     (d) In addition, the Thematic Working Group on Resource Efficient Growth organized three roundtables during the APFSD in 2017, which covered the in-depth regional review of three of the Goals that well be reviewed in-depth during the HLPF: Goals 2 (hunger/food/agriculture) 9 (industrialization) and 14 (Oceans). The roundtables enabled countries to exchange their early experiences and challenges in the implementation of the SDGs and to develop their positions for the in-depth reviews to be held at the HLPF. The outcomes of the three roundtables have also been recorded in three summary documents and included in the APFSD report.    (e) The Thematic Working Group on Statistics (TWG-STAT) is undertaking an inventory of ongoing and planned statistical capacity development assistance for the SDGs in Asia and the Pacific in order to identify areas that require additional support by the UN system and facilitate collaboration among the UN system in providing the required support.

		"q9": "The 2030 Agenda and SDGs are as much a strategic plan for the UN as for its member states. What is needed is an implementation plan but this is best approached not in one over-arching document but rather through a three-tiered strategic implementation plan, cascading from the national to regional to global levels.     At the national level the UNDAFs should be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and become de facto the UN's national strategic plan for supporting implementation of the 2030 Agenda. In line with the UNDS reforms, these \"SDG ready\" UNDAFs would help to bring the UNDS together (resident and non-resident) and ensure alignment of the UN's operations with country priorities. Better involvement of Regional Commissions as per the UNDS reform would help the SDG UNDAFs to reflect cross boarder and transboundary issues. Regional Commissions can also ensure UNDAFs are better aligned with and support regional and globally agreed processes like ones on migration, disability, ageing etc. The official sign off between the UN and the country is important to formalize this national level strategic plan.     Similarly, at the regional level, a regional strategic plan should match the offer of the UNDS with the regional needs of member States. Again, the official sign off between the UN and the member states in the region it is an important part to formalize this national level strategic plan it would need to be discussed and ultimately adopted through a regional intergovernmental process.  In the Asian and Pacific region, member States of ESCAP adopted the Regional Roadmap for implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific with the following objectives: (a) strengthened regional cooperation on priority issues as identified by member States; (b) continued and more efficient and coordinated support for member States provided by the secretariat, United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies and regional organizations through the Asia-Pacific Regional Coordination Mechanism; and (c) more effective knowledge sharing among countries.  This document now provides the definitive framework for assistance to be extended to countries on implementation of the SDGs in the region.  The Roadmap was adopted by the ESCAP Commission and is reviewed annually at the Asia Pacific Forum for Sustainable development.    At the global level a strategic plan could bring together the national and regional plans and provide the linkages with relevant global processes such as on migration, social development etc.  ",
		"q10": "• Financing for SDGs requires that various sources of funding, public and private, are mobilized to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The UN System has networks and expertise that cover these different sources of funding and coordinating around the goals of the financing agenda would help increase effectiveness of the raising and use of these funds.    • Voluntary National Reviews [VNRs] can be the component connecting global, regional and national levels. As an example of good practice, ESCAP worked together with UN Country Teams in supporting national follow up and review including through Voluntary National Reviews in the context of the \"Rapid Response Facility\" (RRF) project in 2017. Lao PDR, which will present its VNR at the High-level Political Forum in 2018 was one of the countries that benefited from this coordinated UN support. ESCAP is also supporting Pacific Island Countries in developing data sets which would help them report effectively in their VNRs.     • Data and statistics for SDGs: Data and statistics for SDGs is an area that requires collective action from the UN and the member States at the level of national statistical systems. For national statistical systems to be able to respond to the increasing demands for data and statistics in the context of the 2030 Agenda, statistical business processes need to be modernized and the role of national statistical offices as coordinators of national statistical systems have to be strengthened. The UN has an established system for developing and maintaining international statistical standards where the UN Statistical Commission is the main body and is supported by the work of regional Committees on Statistics. Statistical support, however, is provided by a multitude of UN entities with various subject matter expertise and entry points in the national statistical system. In order to achieve the required transformation of national statistical systems, , coordinated UN support linking global and regional statistical standards with national policies and capacity building, is necessary. Recognizing this need, member States and development partners in Asia and the Pacific have agreed on a collective vision and framework for action for advancing official statistics for the 2030 agenda within the ESCAP Committee on Statistics. The implementation of this framework in partnership by UN entities and beyond would be an ideal way of coordinating support to national statistical systems for data and statistics for SDGs.  ",

The Common Chapter of the 4 agencies, funds and programmes' Strategic Plans contributes jointly to the implementation of the SDGs in a collaborative manner by building on each other's transformative strength. Furthermore, UNFPA is also committed to the \"Delivering as One\" approach and the system-wide coherence principles contained in the Standard Operating Procedures, and its country programmes are fully aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAF).      As an active member of the Inter-agency Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), UNFPA has worked closely with other UN agencies in developing metadata and methodologies for the selected SDG indicators of which UNFPA is a co-/custodian agency.     UNFPA has worked closely with UN Regional Economic Commissions to ensure that the resolutions establishing the Regional Forums for Sustainable Development (RFSD), as well as the work programmes of the RFSD,   incorporated the follow up to the outcomes of the major UN Conferences and Summits of the 1990s, including the ICPD Programme of Action.     On the programmatic side, there are a number of joint initiatives that UNFPA is undertaking with other UN organizations. The UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) has demonstrated the effectiveness of the two UN agencies working as partners to eliminate the FGM, and UNFPA has launched a new roadmap to reduce new HIV infections with UNAIDS in 2017. All of these joint initiatives/programmes contribute to achieving the SDGs.     Furthermore, the UNDG has rolled out a common approach known as MAPS (Mainstreaming, Acceleration, Policy Support) to better support Member States in the implementation of the SDGs. MAPS de-facto represents a set of tools and shared resource to the UNCTs to engage with the governments and partners on the SDGs. At the global level, UNFPA has actively participated in the development of different elements of the common approach, including the Reference Guide on Mainstreaming the SDGs. UNFPA field colleagues viewed a common platform as a means to facilitate coordinated and harmonious support to the SDGs delivery, improved division of labor with leveraged resources and individual comparative advantages of UN agencies. UNFPA, with its broad country-level presence is engaged – and in many cases – leads on behalf of the UNCT in the wide spectrum of the SDG nationalization process. Following the broad categories of the UNDG Mainstreaming Guide under the MAPS approach, UNFPA colleagues are active in raising public awareness, applying multi- stakeholder approaches, tailoring the SDGs to the national context, and based on our comparative advantage in data, supporting monitoring and reporting of SDGs.

		"q1": "UNHCR is the global refugee institution and a protection agency, and its mandate is to provide international protection and support states in seeking permanent solutions for the problem of refugees, as well as prevent and find solutions to the problem of statelessness.    In legal terms, the High Commissioner and his Office form a multilateral, intergovernmental institution, established by the GA as its subsidiary organ. The Statue of UNHCR describes the Office's work as humanitarian and social and of an entirely non-political character.     The High Commissioner's refugee mandate is embedded in public international law, and in particular international refugee and human rights law. Through a series of GA resolutions, UNHCR has also been called upon to assist internally displaced persons. Currently, this role is mostly executed within the context of humanitarian emergencies, where UNHCR is part of the interagency coordination approach. This approach has been developed through a series of GA resolutions and inter agency protocols to ensure a more predictable and focused response to humanitarian emergencies, in particular to support the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced.  The approach fully respects the mandates of the respective entities, and with UNHCR focusing specifically on the protection, provision of emergency shelter and ensuring camp coordination for internally displaced in conflict situations. In addition, in line with the SG's Policy Decision on Return of Refugees and IDPs, UNHCR plays a role in IDP returnee settings.    UNHCR's contribution to the SDGs is in the spirit of the overarching principles of \"leave no one behind\" and \"reaching the furthest behind first\", targeted to persons of UNHCR's concern - refugees, asylum seekers, returnees, and stateless persons – as well as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).     With the above in mind, UNHCR's functions are mainly in advancing, advocating and providing protection and supporting states to ensure that they fulfil their obligations under international law in regards to the achievements of rights, including ensuring protection and providing equal access to basic rights and services, as well as pursuing durable solutions. This is conducted on the one hand through setting policies, providing advice to legal/ legislative process, and advocacy in order to shape the international refugee system and on the other by providing direct assistance to refugees, both legal and material. In addition, UNHCR maintains a strong emergency response capacity that is deployed to new refugee situations to ensure humanitarian assistance and coordination of all actors involved in the refugee response, under the overall leadership of the host Government.  Resource mobilisation also plays an important part.    In the lead-up to the 2030 Agenda, UNHCR worked together with other agencies, such as IOM, OCHA and the Special rapporteur of the Human Rights of IDPs, to ensure that all persons of concern to UNHCR were included in its guiding vision through the principle of leave no one behind that underpins the Agenda.     As set out in the organisation's Strategic Directions 2017-2021, UNHCR will:  •\t\"Build on the commitment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to leave no-one behind, and on the Sustainable Development Goals to promote the inclusion of refugees, the internally displaced and stateless people in National Development Frameworks.  •	Engage strongly with States, host communities, civil society and key national service providers to promote the inclusion of refugees, internally displaced and stateless people in mainstream national systems, including health and education, pending durable solutions to their displacement.\"    In a mandatory instruction issued in December 2017 with an overview of requirements for UNHCR reporting on 2017, implementation in 2018 and planning for 2019, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have a prominent place. Seeking the involvement of development actors in addressing forced displacement and statelessness is an important operational objective of UNHCR. As such, Representatives and Directors must ensure and advocate for the inclusion of refugees and other persons of concern in national development plans in line with the SDG guidance issued in September 2016. Additional UNHCR guidance has been developed relating to programming specifically for education and for prevention and response to statelessness to further support achievement of the relevant SDGs.    Launch of the Solutions and Resilience Division in the UNHCR HQs in 2018 is in spirit of the 2030 Agenda, and development-humanitarian nexus. The new division will foster and institutionalize more close partnership to ensure goals of the 2030 Agenda are achieved for displaced population.",

UNHCR continues to advocate for accelerated and inclusive implementation of the SDGs globally and at country levels. Official Guidance on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Addressing Statelessness, Refugee Education and Sustainable Development and Principles for Identification for Sustainable Development have been issued. This is also made publically available as a ways of sharing good practice and learning on UNHCR's official website: www.unhcr.org/2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development.html.    UNHCR's Biennial Programme Budget and UNHCR's Strategic Directions (2017-2021) provide UNHCR's overall framework of work. Further important developments to guide UNHCR's operations in focusing on this include:   •\tthe Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework;  •	UNHCR's shift towards Multi-year planning and multi-partner as the organization's new approach to strategic planning, currently launched in 22 operations and as of 2020 across the organization (please see UNHCR's Biennial Programme Budget 2016/17 [revised], paragraph 116)  •	A revision of UNHCR's Results-based management system to enable the organization to systematically and reliably plan, monitor and measure this as of 2020.  •	An internal review of UNHCR's response to internal displacement, focusing on ensuring stronger and more predictable action to situations of internal displacement.     UNHCR is currently working with other actors (such as the World Bank) to leverage existing data platforms to feed forcibly displaced data for the different sectors (e.g. Energy, Education, Livelihoods, WASH).

UNHCR's dual mandate of solutions and protection for forcibly displaced calls for sustainable solutions such as mainstreaming access to services and programs into national development plans. At the sector level the Education and Health team have mainstreaming into national systems as a core pillar to the approach, and Livelihoods, Energy, and Environment work closely at building sustainable solutions through non-traditional partners particularly through development, government line ministries, and private sector partners.    In Turkey, the joint programme on rule of law and human rights will build on existing support from UN agencies to national rule of law systems. The programme will ensure the inclusion of refugees with specific attention to needs related to gender based violence and women's empowerment.      In Myanmar, the joint project aims to enable policy-makers and local stakeholders to include the needs of forcibly displaced persons and affected communities in administrative justice reform processes.

The Recommendations make specific reference to reporting on refugee populations along SDG indicators, and provide recommendations for building capacity and coordination among statistical entities to assist in such reporting.    To improve sustainable solutions for refugees, promoting the economic inclusion of refugees has been a core pillar of the CRRF and wider solutions approach. To inform policy makers on the benefits and risks of economic inclusion of forcibly displaced, UNHCR has invested in building the evidence base of the economic impact of refugees on host communities and in partnerships with development actors like the World Bank to improve data on poverty. To that end, UNHCR has a set of projects open to improve data and evidence with the World Bank particularly to inform the design of the WB IDA 18 refugee and host community sub-window.

Under this model, all organisations working with refugees can publish their plans and seek funding. In some countries this has developed into a 3RP approach, linking humanitarian and development agencies together. In the MENA region, in the past 5 years, this has resulted in a 13 billion aid programme, coordinated by UNHCR, in support of the governments hosting Syrian refugees. On an annual basis the RRPs bring in around 4 billion USD, with more than 50 % of funds granted to partner agencies. The RRP process answers the donor and host country demand for one coordinated plan to avoid duplication and better address gaps in the initial refugee response.

		"q5": "UNHCR is an active member of the CEB, UNDG, ECESA Plus, RCM, and UN-Water.    For the UNDG, in 2017, UNHCR was a member of the ASG Advisory Group and all of the Results Groups and the various Task Team of the UNDG. In 2018, UNHCR is a member of the UNDG Core Group as well as a member of the Joint Steering Committee to Advance Humanitarian – Development Collaboration. UNHCR continues to recommend a reduction in results groups, working groups and task forces in favour of a select number of prioritised groups (ensuring no overlap) focusing on the most pressing issues needing attention by the UNDG.  This could be achieved by comprehensively mapping the entire eco-system of coordination mechanism that exists which touches on development and/or UNDS to ensure that there are no duplications in the work plans and discussions in order to avoid the same topics being discussed at multiple forum with slightly differing membership. For example, the current TOR of the revamped UNDG plans for 5 results groups. It would be preferable to have fewer results group taking into consideration existing coordination mechanisms (eg HLCM, HLCP, IASC, SPG, PCG, ECESA Plus) and newly established (eg Joint Steering Committee on enhancing Development and Humanitarian Collaboration). Moreover, UNHCR recommends far less voluminous policy guidance to the field in favour of a similar streamlined approach as well as more streamlined data collection by various UN coordination mechanism on seemingly similar topics.    UNHCR is a member of UN-Water and also sits on the Executive committee.  UNHCR is most actively involved in policy advice, normative support, and general advocacy.  Specifically this involves identification of strategic issues and priorities in key summary reports (e.g. World Water Development Reports (WWDR) and through the identification of solutions (e.g. UN-Water Expert Groups and Task Forces).  UN-Water also is responsible for dissemination and communication around UN-Water family reports including JMP, GLAAS and GEMI- relevant to the water-related SDGs (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11.5, and 13).    In Europe and Central-Asia, UNHCR is co-Chairing with UNDP the Issue-Based Coalition (IBC) on Large Movements of People, Displacement and Resilience. UNHCR facilitated adoption of the ‘Key Messages' – a high level advocacy document agreed among the IBC members (UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNWOMEN, UNOPS, IOM and UN Environment) that will be used by UN agencies in all applicable fora to advocate for solutions for persons of concern in Europe and Central Asia. In 2018, the IBC will continue serving as a platform for UN agencies to address the current issues with regard to persons of concern, with the aim of positively influencing perceptions, public discourse and policies on refugees, migrants and affected populations. The IBC will also provide coherent UN support at country level towards SDGs nationalization, making sure that the persons of concern are included under ‘no one left behind' principle.    Currently, there are over 10.5 million refugees, migrants, stateless and IDPs in Europe and Central Asia. Europe is likely to remain a destination for refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in 2018, from situations as far afield as Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), as well as from crises within Europe, such as that in Ukraine. Turkey remains host to the world's largest refugee population, with 3.4 million refugees and asylum-seekers, the vast majority of whom (3.15 million) originate from Syria. The lack of durable solutions—including limited integration prospects in many first countries of asylum and a limited number of legal pathways—leaves many with few choices but to attempt migration to Europe, and refugees and migrants are likely to continue to risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean Sea in search of safety.

The CRRF approach is being piloted in Central America, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia Situation, Tanzania and Uganda.  Host governments' leadership and ownership are central to an effective and sustainable comprehensive response. In CRRF countries, governments are engaging a variety of stakeholders, including line ministries, local authorities, development partners, UN and NGO partners, the private sector and financial institutions, while ensuring the partnership with the refugees themselves. This is being done through government-led CRRF secretariats or steering-groups that work with stakeholders to assess needs and develop prioritized strategies. Existing UN coordination mechanisms are being leveraged through active involvement of the Resident Coordinators and Humanitarian Coordinators, encouraging greater cooperation across institutional mandates.

End preventable maternal, newborn and child deaths  2. Promote the health and development of all children.   And the WASH strategy focuses on the first two SDG 6 targets as the centerpiece of our programming work:    1.

By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.    The SDG target (16.2) on ending all forms of violence against children was the result of advocacy from UNICEF and key child-focused partners, that the SDGs needed to directly address the child protection agenda in a way that the MDGs did not.  UNICEF has been strongly focused on Ending Violence against children and was a key partner in launching the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children.      UNICEF also strongly advocated for the inclusion of a specific reference to child poverty within the SDG framework, which is important for understanding how resources may be allocated within a household.

On-the-field and remote training is granted to people from ministries and governments in a total timespan of six months, in order to progressively nurture the beneficiaries and assure a solid knowledge and expertise on Earth observations for decision-making.  UNITAR-UNOSAT directly addresses SDG 9, especially in the targets 9.A and 9.B, as, in this context, it promotes innovation and up to date Earth observations technology for sustainable management of resources and of the environment. Between 2016 and 2017, a number of trainings have been conducted in Bangladesh, Thailand, Chad, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Myanmar, Sudan and Cambodia.  An intended additional activity will be the capacity development in the use of Geospatial Information Technology for climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation for Small Island Develping States in the Pacific. This project will contribute in the implementation of SDGs 1, 2 and 13.   2.	Rapid Mapping for Climate-related disaster Response: This activity directly focuses on SDGs 1, 11 and 13 and the related targets 1.5, 11.5 and 13.1. In case of a natural disaster, such as floods, earthquakes, tropical cyclones, landslides or volcanoes, UNITAR-UNOSAT provides timely and high quality geospatial products in support of emergency managers and coordinators, by using the latest technology for mapping and analyzing different kinds of satellite imagery. Only in 2017 has the rapid mapping service been activated 35 times, in support of emergency coordinators and managers during disasters such as the hurricanes Irma and Maria and the earthquakes in Mexico and on the Iran/Iraq border.  3.	Mapping for Human Security, human rights and application of the international humanitarian law: This activity contributes to the implementation of SDG 16, and specifically to the achievement of 5 of the related targets (16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.10).  It consists in the production high quality and timely satellite imagery analyses on conflict-related issues such as the detection of internally displaced population (IDPs), building damage assessments or human security-related analyses. An additional service UNITAR-UNOSAT provides to conflict-affected countries is the generation of satellite-detected assessments of the condition of UNESCO World heritage Sites (target 11.4). These services support the United Nations in peacekeeping and human security operations through the production of reports and geospatial analyses. Moreover, upon specific request of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNITAR-UNOSAT has develops satellite-detected evidence of crimes against humanity (target 16.3) and has testified at the International Criminal Court.  4.	Development of sustainable water resource management Programme in the Lake Chad region: This project, due to its interdisciplinary nature, is crosscutting in the 2030 Agenda framework. It addresses most of the SDGs, with a particular focus on SDG 6 (targets 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.A, 6.B) and 12 (targets 12.2 and 12.A). This activity provides field- and satellite-based assessments of the water resources in Chad, which leads to the production of a thorough hydrogeological atlas of the entire country, and the development of an Information System of Water Resources (SIRE). Moreover, UNITAR-UNOSAT is the developing a flood resilience system for the Lake Chad Region. It consists in the creation of a flood risk model, which integrates meteorological, hydrological, and inundation data in order to generate early warning systems, forecasts and simulated flood scenarios. This tool, in the form of bulletins and maps, addresses issues such as flood and drought risk, food security and WASH-related problematics. Such activity will contribute to the achievement of a number of goals, specifically SDGs 1 (target 1.5), 2 (target 2.1, 2.3, 2.4), 3 (targets 3.3, 3.D), 6 (targets 6.1, 6.2, 6.5), 11 (targets 11.5, 11.B) and 13 (targets 13.1, 13.2, 13.3).

Each year, more than 2,000 officials and professionals mainly from developing countries participate in 50 to 60 online courses, seminars, workshops, and communities of practice. The evaluation results and in particular the high participant satisfaction confirm that online courses and communities of practice are an effective complement to face-to-face training, including for developing and least developed countries.   UNITAR-UNOSAT has engaged with members of ministries and of government through training and capacity building activities. These were focused on the use of geospatial technology for sound decision-making in the fields of water resource management, and climate-related disaster risk reduction/mitigation. The targeted countries in the last two years have been: Bangladesh, Thailand, Chad, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Myanmar, Sudan and Cambodia.  Lessons learnt:  POSITIVE: Thanks to the improved training methodology spread out in a six-month period, the positive impact of the trainings on the developing countries is stronger. In addition, a greater awareness of geospatial technologies such as Google Earth has increased the interest in these trainings amongst stakeholders.  NEGATIVE: There is still a gap between the country decision-makers and the experts in geospatial analyses, as well as a lack of open-data culture. This results in a sporadic distribution of interest and awareness of the utility of such technology within the ministries.   PROPOSED SOLUTION: UNITAR-UNOSAT will continue conducting a top-down training, targeting people of ministries, and not necessarily IT experts, in order to fill the gap and ensure a more widespread awareness of the utility of Geospatial Information Technology amongst members of governments.

UNISPACE+50 is a very timely opportunity to strengthen their mandates to better address current developments and challenges in outer space activities on the global scale.  The whole process of UNISPACE+50 coincides with the ever growing importance of space applications and technologies for the humankind, but also with global efforts, goals and targets of the three international frameworks: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The shared goal and the outcome of UNISPACE+50 is a comprehensive and a long-term vision – the Space2030 agenda – for the contribution of space activities to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, addressing overarching, long-term development concerns based on the peaceful exploration and uses of outer space.  The comprehensive Space2030 agenda is an overarching document for strategy in the space domain in the support of Sustainable Development Goals. It is established around four pillars that were agreed upon in 2016 in Dubai during the High Level Forum: Space as a Driver for Socio-Economic Sustainable Development. Space economy aims to bring space-related economic benefits to the world's population and support space sector as a major driver for a dynamic economy. Space society focuses on making the best use of space technology, services and applications for improving the quality of life in societies worldwide. In order to bring benefits of space to all, space accessibility aims to provide access to use of space technology, data, information and products and ultimately physical access to space for all countries. None of the above would be possible without mutual respect and equal engagement among nations supported by space diplomacy to address the common challenges of humanity through partnerships.

As part of its strategic effort to help ensure their inclusion, UNODC will strengthen and expand its technical cooperation and normative assistance programmes that aim at working with women, children, prisoners and agrarian workers cultivating illicit drug crops.    UNODC has intensified its efforts to ensure access to justice by scaling up its programmes on legal aid, violence against children in the criminal justice system and prison reform. In addition, has extended its programmes on access to drug dependence treatment and its joint programme with WHO to ensure the availability of pain medication. Extra efforts will also be made to expand drug treatment services for women and, through expansion of family based interventions, provisions of prevention services to children at risk.    By launching a new global programme on prison reform, the Office has amplified its efforts to implement the Nelson Mandela Rules on treatment of Prisoners and the Bangkok Rules on Treatment of Women prisoners and non-custodial measures. UNODC also launched a new global programme on alternative development that focuses on assisting marginalised agrarian communities by addressing  their specific needs and integrating these efforts with the broader development effort at the national level.

Support SDG Global Monitoring  UNODC has, in collaboration with national experts, redesigned its global tool to collect data from Member States on crime and criminal justice system (UN Crime Trend Survey) and has started a process with national experts to redesign the tool to collect data on the drug problem to reflect the SDG global indicators. UNODC is also developing, in collaboration with national experts and relevant regional and international entities, a new global questionnaire to collect data on firearm trafficking to feed the global monitoring of SDG indicator 16.4.2 (proportion of seized small arms and light weapons that are recorded and traced, in accordance with international standards and legal instruments). The Database on wildlife seizures is also in the process of being revitalized to ensure a proper base to globally monitor indicator 15.7.1.         Development of guidelines to support countries to produce SDG indicators  UNODC remains engaged in the work of the Inter-Agency Expert Group on SDG indicators and under its guidance it is developing a new methodology to develop tier II and III SDG indicators. The Office has developed guidelines to use victimization surveys to estimate SDG indicators; it has developed an innovative methodology (Multi-System-Estimation) to estimate the total number of trafficking in persons victims (SDG indicator 16.2.2); it is finalizing with UNDP a manual to guide countries to conduct population and business surveys to estimate bribery (SDG indicators 16.5.1 and 16.5.2); and in collaboration with UNCTAD is developing a methodology to measure illicit financial flows (SDG indicator 16.4.1).     National capacity development  UNODC is implementing programmes to support Member States to produce and disseminate relevant SDG indicators through regional and national capacity building activities often in collaboration with other agencies.  Moving forward the Office is looking into the possibility of developing a new global programme on SDG reporting. It is envisaged that this will be based on three main pillars: i) Building capacity of Member States to generate and analyse data to measure progress towards relevant SDG targets; ii) Strengthening the global monitoring of SDG targets; iii) Strengthening capacity of Member States to analyze SDG indicators and use them into the policy-making processes at the national, regional and global levels.

The cooperation reflects a vision integrating development strategies at the global, regional and national levels. Global priorities were defined during the 2016 UPU Congress, with a priority on improving operational efficiency and the development of e-commerce.     The UPU regional Development Plans (RDP) define actions and engagements with stakeholder groups at the country and regional level. RDP have been approved for each of the 6 UPU regions, with specific projects focusing on capacity building in Financial Inclusion, Digital transformation and diversification and Operational Efficiency for E-commerce.     Technical assistance to governments in two countries (Tunisia and Morocco) towards reducing the export frictions for MSME by empowering the universal postal network to support MSME across the country – directly contributing to SDG 17.11.    Moreover, beyond the cooperation and development function, the UPU conducts a number of projects in areas which support the ability of countries to achieve SDG-relevant goals.    Climate change    UPU provides postal operators in all its 192 member countries with access to a free tool and technical support to measure and analyse their climate impact. UPU also provides support, best practice exchange and capacity building on sustainability to its member countries and postal operators worldwide, including knowledge sharing on climate mitigation. In addition, UPU provides technical assistance and capacity building to its member countries on disaster risk reduction and preparedness.    The UPU participates in UN Environment     Financial inclusion: activities of the UPU linked to the relevant SDGs     Financial inclusion as a key tool for poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth   According to the 2014 Global Findex, 2 billion adults worldwide do not have access to formal financial services. Groups of people that are the most financially excluded include the poor, people out of a job (unemployed or retired), or women. Yet access to formal financial services is a key lever for socio-economic development, as recognized in six of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, and 10). When confronted with a life shock (illness, accident, natural disaster, etc.), access to insurance, savings, or remittance services can be the difference between resilience or sinking below the poverty line. Similarly, easy access to various payment services or to loans can help empower people, create livelihoods including though small businesses, which can then lead to increased wealth and job creation in their community.   Posts have traditionally been strong financial inclusion contributors and remain so. As shown in the 2016  UPU Global panorama of postal financial inclusion, Posts are the second biggest contributor to financial inclusion worldwide, after banks, but \"far ahead of microfinance institutions, money-transfer organizations, cooperatives, insurance companies, mobile money operators and all other providers of financial services\".  Indeed, 1 billion people worldwide in 87 countries hold a total of 2 billion payment or savings accounts at Posts. Furthermore, 183 Posts – or 91% of all Posts – offer at least one type of financial service. As such, apart from the 1 billion account holders, an estimated 500 million additional people worldwide access payment services such as remittances or government payments through a post office.   Link to the 2016 Global panorama:  http://www.upu.int/uploads/tx_sbdownloader/globalPanoramaOnPostalFinancialInclusion2016En.pdf   But these massive numbers are not the only reason why Posts are so important to financial inclusion. It is also that Posts, as institutions typically with public good missions, have a mandate to address the needs of all populations, and not just the urban, the well-off, or the more educated. Two recent studies led by UN Women and the UPU, and by the World Bank and the UPU, support that statement. They show that Posts are comparatively better than other financial institutions in banking segments of the population that tend to be excluded, such as women,  the poor, the less educated and those in the informal economy.    If we add to this the extensive physical network of Posts – more than 660,000 locations worldwide, present in rural areas as much as urban areas ¬– and the trust factor from which a large number of Posts benefit, we realize that Posts are in fact uniquely positioned to advance financial inclusion.  In a study published in 2013 with the World Bank, (\"Financial Inclusion and the Role of the Post Office\") looks at the profile of people that are using financial services offered by Post. It clearly concludes that compared to banks, Posts have a much larger proportion of clients that are usually in the most financially excluded categories of population, such as the poor or those in the informal economy.    Posts as a driver for women economic empowerment through financial inclusion  The access to financial services for women is widely recognized as a key driver for women's economic empowerment. A joint study led by UNWomen and the UPU demonstrates the non-discriminatory nature of Posts in the provision of financial services. Greater financial inclusion of women is a win-win development strategy with the potential to positively impact growth and human development as well as women's social and economic empowerment. The joint UNWomen/UPU study demonstrates that postal services have a vital role to play in this process and a positive and measurable impact.   On average, in developing countries, postal financial institutions (postal banks or postal savings banks) have twice as many female customers as other financial institutions. This phenomenon is even more marked in rural areas.   Link to the study:   http://www.upu.int/uploads/tx_sbdownloader/genderAndFinancialInclusionThroughThePostEn.pdf     Expanding the access to insurance services through the postal networks   Insurance is one of four pillars of financial inclusion. Insurance products can make a significant positive difference in the lives of vulnerable individuals by helping households mitigate shocks and improve the management of expenses related to unforeseen events such as medical emergencies, a death in the family, theft or natural disasters. However, there is a persistent insurance gap, particularly in developing countries.   A joint study conducted by the UPU and the International Labor organization (ILO's Impact Insurance Facility) demonstrates how Posts can serve as an inclusive distribution channel for insurance products to excluded populations in developing countries.    Link to the study:  http://www.upu.int/uploads/tx_sbdownloader/advancingFinancialInclusionThroughAccessToInsuranceTheRoleOfPostalNetworksEn.pdf     Lowering the cost of remittances for migrants   In the early 2000s, the UPU developed the International Financial System (IFS), a money transfer tool that it makes available to Posts. In accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 10c, which is to reduce to less than 3% the transaction costs of migrant remittances by 2030, the UPU helps Posts offer their customers secure and affordable services. Over 80 Posts currently use IFS, which was updated in 2013 for use on mobile devices and which can be man¬aged remotely via cloud computing for Posts that do not have sufficient technical capacity.   According to the World Bank, post offices are the world's cheapest providers of remittance services. Posts have already reached the 5X5 objective, with an average cost of about 4%. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, if all remittances were channelled through post offices at that cost, migrants and their families could save up to 3.2 billion USD a year. A project led by the UPU and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in the rural areas of six West African countries between 2008 and 2010, showed that connecting rural post offices had a strong impact on costs for customers, with prices going down by 30 to 50% in the region as a consequence of the project.     UPU's endeavor in leveraging postal networks to advance financial inclusion   In parallel to this operational and regulatory work in the field of money transfers, the UPU has also been implementing since 2008 a series of activities in the field of financial inclusion. Most of this was scaled up starting in 2011, with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The UPU's financial inclusion agenda can be divided in three complementary pillars:  •\tResearch: the UPU, on its own or in partnership with other institutions, has led extensive research activities on the contribution of Posts to financial inclusion. Those researches clearly demonstrates the role Posts play a very important roel in providing financial services to the populations excluded from the formal financial services markets ( women, poor, rural populations)   •	Advocacy and partnerships: The UPU is leading a series of activities years to ensure that the postal sector was recognized as a valuable contributor to financial inclusion and has built strategic partnerships with a number of UN (World Bank, the International Labour Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, UN Women), and non UN organizations (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, CGAP) and private sector companies. Those partners are increasingly recognizing Posts as valuable partners to advance financial inclusion.  •	Technical Assistance (TA):   UPU TA has been provided on the following topics:  -	Assistance to Posts to design new business models;   -	Assistance to Central Banks to help them better understand the scope of financial services offered by Posts and the different models of regulations;  -	Assistance to Posts for the establishment of partnerships with mobile money operators or banks;  -	Design and launch of new digital financial services.  In parallel, the UPU is conducting country-level specific projects with other partners, which link financial inclusion through the post and local economic development. This is the case for example in Burundi, where a joint project with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is currently being implemented. ",

For instance, partnerships with statistical offices of other organizations such as UNCTAD, WTO, OECD, WCO, ICAO and the World Bank have been sought with the aim of improving the data and insights associated with infrastructure and electronic services (pertinent to Goal 9 of the UN SDGs). UPU also works in partnership with WMO on issues relating to environment, climate and resilience. UPU is an active contributor to Sustainable United Nations, through which we collaborate with other UN agencies on coherent environmental strategies and their implementation.    In a report organized by the ITU and launched at the High-level Policy Forum (HLPF) held in New York from 10 to 19 July 2017 , UN agencies recognized that information and communication technologies (ICTs) constituted both a risk and an opportunity in terms of achieving the UN SDGs. The UPU contributed to this report with a thought piece that showed how the organization, as a unique knowledge centre for the postal sector, can leverage information and communication technologies (ICTs) in order to collect, share and analyze data that supports development policies.     As an example of this expertise, the UPU highlighted the work done in the context of the UPU–UN Global Pulse partnership, which revealed that by leveraging ICTs, the UPU's big data was able to generate reliable social and economic development indicators, even in cases of patchy macroeconomic data (e.g. where local statistical capabilities are weak). This data is invaluable for policymakers, donors, fundraisers, project managers and all key stakeholders in the technical cooperation arena who are eager to measure the potential and actual impact of projects in the field.    Another example is the UPU's leadership role in a workstream of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), coordinating Action Line C7 (e-business) with UNCTAD and the International Trade Centre (ITC). A full report of the progress made in the implementation of the outcomes of WSIS is published every year by the UN Commission on Science and Technology for Development.     During the WSIS Forum in May 2017, the UPU promoted the contribution of the postal network and of UPU projects (e.g. ECOMPRO and the Easy Export Programme) in enabling SMEs to actively use e-commerce and better leverage the digital economy, so as to meet SDG target 17.11 on export growth in least developed countries and other developing countries.

Guided by the theme \"Delivering sustainable development: Connecting citizens, businesses and territories,\" ministers' discussions reaffirmed the Post's role as a driver of global development. More than 50 ministers in charge of the postal sector gathered for the conference.  Indeed, for almost every one of the SDGs, postal networks around the globe are already providing solutions – either alone or in partnership with others sectors and networks. Fostering social and financial inclusion, facilitating trade and commerce, and delivering innovation and the information society to all are the key areas of the postal contribution to this world agenda for development. These areas of focus underline governments' priorities and are also indicators for governmental investment and policy, and for international development partners and donors.  The discussion at the 2016 Ministerial Conference centered on inclusion, trade and the digital economy, since these were considered the three main drivers of national development that the Post is involved in delivering with the Sustainable Development Goals.  Panelists considered for instance the Post's far-reaching network to drive social and financial inclusion. One example put forward was Kenya's Huduma Centre concept, where citizens in remote areas can access vital government services through the extensive postal network in the country.    Ministers also lauded the role of the Post in facilitating global trade, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), who often find it difficult to export their goods.  Furthermore, speakers noted the important role played by the Post's physical network in connecting customers to the digital world and facilitating the transition to serving a new, younger market. They also pointed out that the Post collects data in key areas, such as communications, logistics, transport and finance, which could also be used to better serve customers.

The most vulnerable countries therefore stand to lose the most if the implementation of the Agenda 2030 and their specific programmes of action does not meet the level of expectations raised in these global frameworks.   In recognition of the complementarities between the 2030 Agenda and the programmes of action for LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS, the strategic framework of OHRLLS' 2018-2019 budget—as approved by the Committee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) and by the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly—contains an additional element under the office's mandate. This additional element relates to \"(e) Building effective linkages between the follow-up and review arrangements of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the three programmes of action.\"   This language builds on a series of UNGA resolutions/declarations, including A/RES/71/238. A/CONF.228/L.1 which provide explicit guidance on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs.    All the work carried out by the office aims to contribute to the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs.  ",

The action plan provides an analysis of the commonalities and complementarities between the programmes of actions and SDGs and set the parameters of how to enhance synergies between the programmes of action and the SDGs in OHRLLS' work. Overall, the action plan offers a roadmap to enhance synergies between the 2030 Agenda and the programmes of action in every step of the office's planning, implementation, monitoring and reporting cycle. The Office has also integrated the 2030 Agenda in its 2018-19 biennium programme budget and included activities into annual work plans. The reports of the Secretary General on the implementation of the VPoA are also dedicated to review the implementation of the POAs and the 2030 Agenda. ",

The office's dialogue with the World Bank at all levels—both the governing body of the Bank and its secretariat—is a perfect illustration of the more institutionalised collaboration with all major stakeholders. Such institutionalised relations resulted into a tripartite collaboration between OHRLLS, the World Bank and member states during the discussions on the recent replenishment of the largest multilateral concessional window—IDA 18. It is important to note that there is now very strong alignment of the priorities of IDA with the SDGs and the substantial increase of resource allocations to the most vulnerable countries.     Further, OHRLLS has increased its engagement with the private sector in support of the implementation of the programmes of action and the 2030 Agenda. One such examples include the SIDS Global Business Network and the SIDS private sector forum, all of which foster private sector development and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) models for SIDS.     The office has also promoted enhanced south-south and triangular cooperation in support of the development agenda of the three groups and the 2030 Agenda. It supported the organisation of a High-Level Round Table on South-South Cooperation on 26 September 2015, which was co-chaired by former Secretary-General Ban and the President of China.

These meetings have been attended by national focal points and experts from concerned sectoral ministries as well representatives from other international and regional organizations, the private sector, civil society, academia.    The office has also extended enhanced and structured support to LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS with regard to their participation and voice in global processes pertaining to the 2030 Agenda. Such support has materialized at least through three channels. First, OHRLLS has generated a growing number of knowledge products, covering a wide range of SDGS-related issues including sustainable energy, broadband connectivity and transport of transit and development finance. Such analytical work has paid focused attention to the priorities, opportunities and challenges of LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.  Second, OHLLS has provided on-demand and evidence-based backstopping support to the three groups during global inter-governmental negotiations on the 2030 Agenda. In particular, the office has organized and substantively serviced ambassadorial and expert-level meetings of the three groups meeting. Third, the office has used its convening power to lend voice to the concerns and needs of three groups at the global stage. OHRLLS has promoted the interests of LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS in major global and regional conferences, which it has organised, participated in or contributed to. For example, OHRLLS in collaboration with the Government of Viet Nam organised a High-Level Meeting for the Euro-Asia Region on Improving Cooperation on Transit, Trade Facilitation and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in March 2017.

These consultative groups provide platforms for cooperation and coordination among the United Nations system and other international organizations in support of the implementation of both the 2030 Agenda and the programme of action. These groups have also been used to mount UN-system responses to address specific issues related to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, including on the Technology Bank, the full operationalization of which is one the targets the SDGs (Target 17. 8).

The office is exploring the possibility of institutionalising the network of national focal points for both SIDS and LLDCs—just as it did for the LDCs. With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, a significant aspect of the work of national focal points relates to support the localisation of the SDGs. The second channel is through UNCT. OHRLLS is currently working with UNDP to help countries harmonize reporting on globally agreed goals, including SDGs, and programmes of action for vulnerable countries so as to ease the transaction cost of complying to multiple reporting processes. The third channel is through its inter-agency coordination work mentioned above, which engage all entities of the UN system.    At the regional level, the office has been working with regional commissions in the context of regular regional reviews of the implementation of the programmes of actions. OHRLLS has seized this opportunity to reflect the synergies between the implementation of these programmes of actions and that of the 2030 Agenda.    At the global level, OHRLLS has, as mentioned before, supported the effective participation of the three groups of countries in intergovernmental processes related to the follow-up and review of the 2030 agenda, including to the high-level political forum, through the articulation of their needs, concerns and interests, and through making the case that these three groups of countries deserve special consideration and treatment in order to overcome their vulnerabilities.

UNOPS does not presume a global policy mandate in relation to the goals, but aims to enhance the implementation capacity of partners wherever its expertise and comparative advantage can add value.   Subsequently, the Biennial Budget Estimates provide the management framework for UNOPS three contributions goals as described by the Strategic Plan. The four management goals – Partner Value, People Excellence, Process Excellence, and Financial Stewardship – with their associated indicators, baselines, targets and allocated resources ensure that UNOPS is fit for purpose and that management resources support the 2030 Agenda while contributing to United Nations management reform.

The Strategic Plan is guided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth in the 2030 Agenda, in particular SDG 2 on ending hunger and SDG 17 on revitalizing global partnerships for implementation of the SDGs. It ushers in a new planning and operational structure, including the implementation of results-based country portfolios that will maximize WFP's contribution to governments' efforts towards achieving the SDGs.  Responding to emergencies and saving lives and livelihoods – either through direct assistance, or by strengthening country capacities – remains at the heart of WFP's operations, especially as humanitarian needs become increasingly complex and protracted.  At the same time, WFP will support countries in ensuring no one is left behind by continuing to build resilience for food security and nutrition and addressing the growing challenges posed by climate change and rising inequality.  Mirroring the structure of the 2030 Agenda, each of the Plan's two Strategic Goals – support countries to achieve Zero Hunger and partner to support implementation of the SDGs – is articulated through Strategic Objectives and Strategic Results, against which progress can be measured.  Implementation of the Strategic Plan (2017–2021) is being adapted in response to local contexts, capacities and partnerships.

The five Strategic Objectives are:  1.\tEnd hunger by protecting access to food  2.	Improve nutrition  3.	Achieve food security  4.	Support SDG implementation   5.	Partner for SDG results  The eight Strategic Results are:  1.	Everyone has access to food (SDG Target 2.1)  2.	No one suffers from malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2)  3.	Smallholders have improved food security and nutrition through improved productivity and incomes (SDG Target 2.3)  4.	Food system are sustainable (SDG Target 2.4)   5.	Developing countries have strengthened capacities to implement the SDGs (SDG Target 17.9)  6.	Policies to support sustainable development coherent (SDG Target 17.14)  7.	Developing countries access a range of financial resources for development investment (SDG Target 17.3)  8.	Sharing of knowledge, expertise and technology, strengthen global partnership support to country efforts to achieve the SDGs (SDG Target 17.16)   The five Strategic Objectives frame WFP's programmatic and operational focus, and are linked to national and global efforts to meet the targets for SDGs 2 and 17. In addition to the eight Strategic Results, WFP also uses Strategic Outcomes, outputs and activities. Each country selects its own Strategic Outcomes, Outputs and Activities, which are linked to standardized categories, allowing for flexibility and contextualization at the country level while ensuring standardized performance measurement and reporting among countries.  The CRF ensures harmonized design, monitoring and reporting for CSPs in all WFP offices. Adoption of the CRF further aligns WFP's monitoring and reporting on results with those of other United Nations agencies, particularly the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund.",
		"q2_4": "Leaving no one behind  WFP is the largest humanitarian organization addressing the challenges of global hunger and nutrition. While WFP's mandate clearly articulates humanitarian and development responsibilities, the organization's comparative advantage and long experience call for prioritization of emergency, life-saving and development-enabling work that benefits the poorest and most marginal people.   The SDGs require moving beyond saving lives to changing lives, focusing first on the people in greatest need, not just in least-developed countries but universally throughout the world.  WFP is committed to reaching those in greatest need first, while ensuring that no one is left behind. Responding to emergencies and saving lives and livelihoods will continue to constitute the major part of WFP's operations while it will focus on aspects of development where food-based interventions are most appropriate.",

		"q3_1": "A WFP's Country Strategic Plan (CSP) is informed by national Zero Hunger Strategic Review (ZHSR), a country-led exercise that determines the collective actions needed to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) by 2030.   WFP facilitates the implementation of ZHSRs and provides technical as well as financial support to the process. ZHSRs provide a comprehensive analysis of the country-specific food security and nutrition challenges through inclusive consultations with a wide range of government stakeholders, civil society, private sector, donors and international organizations.   Although focused on SDG2, the interdependent nature of the 17 SDGs mandates means that the ZHSR incorporates the multi-sectoral dimensions of food insecurity and malnutrition - achieving zero hunger is only possible if progress towards all SDGs is made, and vice versa. As such, cross-sectoral and cross institutional partnerships are essential to make Agenda 2030 a reality. Fostering relations between stakeholders is therefore an integral part and goal of the ZHSR process.  The purpose of the ZHSR is to support governments and other partners to achieve SDG2 - to \"end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture\". The process can be understood as a contribution to fulfilling a country's commitment to Agenda 2030 by offering a tested formula and approach on how to localize/domesticate SDG2. At the end of the process, a comprehensive analytical report highlighting the priority actions required to achieve zero hunger is endorsed by stakeholders.   Since 2014, WFP supported more than 60 countries in initiating Zero Hunger Strategic Reviews that so far led to the approval of 20 CSPs in 2017. Five (5) countries where Zero Hunger Strategic Reviews were not feasible at present opted to develop Interim CSPs.   Engaging a large number of stakeholders during the strategic review process and in the development of one comprehensive and multi-year portfolio prompted varying expectations and opinions regarding WFP's role in a country. The strategic review's focus on building evidence for WFP's value proposition based on recommendations and collective goals has helped to develop a shared vision and understanding of WFP's future portfolio among partners.   Governments are welcoming the opportunity to align WFP's work with national plans, including economic and social development plans. CSPs are also facilitating more effective partnerships with governments and the transfer of capabilities, which helps to increase WFP's focus on exit strategies.  WFP contributes directly and indirectly to other national priorities and other SDGs through the outputs of its activities. As stated in the WFP Strategic Plan 2017-2021, WFP will collaborate with partners, including IFAD and FAO, to leverage each one's capacities and strengths to support countries to achieve the SDGs.",

In 2017, the OEWG on SDGs, supported by the Technical Task Team, developed and conveyed the CFS contribution to the 2017 HLPF held under the global follow-up and review theme \"Eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world\". Specific SDGs under in-depth review were SDGs 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14 and 17. The 2018 HLPF \"Transformation towards sustainable and resilient societies\" will review SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12, 15, and 17.   WFP provided substantial inputs to both of the CFS contributions to the 2017 and 2018 HLPF. The CFS contributions strongly reaffirm that country-level implementation of the Agenda 2030, in support of governments' efforts towards Zero Hunger, is central.   WFP co-organized the \"Reaching those left furthest behind: Addressing hunger and poverty in protracted crises\" side-event during the 2017 HLPF, together with the FAO, IFAD and the CFS, and hosted by the Netherlands' Mission to the United Nations in New York. This event underlined the need to bring humanitarian assistance and longer-term development efforts together in protracted crises contexts - to address immediate food security and nutrition needs, strengthen the resilience of agricultural systems and livelihoods and work towards achieving the SDGs.

		"q5": "WFP's Strategic Plan (2017–2021) allows WFP to evolve with other entities of the United Nations Development System (UNDS). These entities serve specific and differing needs, reflected in their specializations and spheres of influence. The 2030 Agenda requires the UNDS to pursue integrated approaches and create cross-sectoral synergies to deliver interlinked results at all levels, supported by an enabling funding and governance architecture. The system has recognized this moment as a window of opportunity and is taking practical measures, both individually and collectively, to do business differently. The UNDS recognizes that its primary focus should be on achieving interlinked and transformative results at country level and promoting national ownership. The UNDS has renewed its commitment to deliver across mandates, sectors and institutional boundaries, working within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations, using more integrated and interconnected approaches.  The 2030 Agenda makes clear that sustainable development hinges on effective partnerships. WFP embraces this imperative, seeking to align and integrate its food assistance capacities and programmes with the interventions and investments of governments, other United Nations agencies, the private sector and civil society, which together can generate the systemic changes for sustainable development. WFP will work in synergy with partners to combine and leverage complementary strengths and resources. The objective will be transparent, equitable and mutually beneficial arrangements with mechanisms for sharing risks, responsibilities and accountability. WFP will rely on partners with stronger comparative advantages, which might be better placed to respond. Commitment to partnership and collective action has long been central to WFP's operations and is at the heart of the 2030 Agenda's global call to action.   Enhanced synergies among the Rome-based agencies (RBA) are paramount to achieving SDG 2. RBA collaboration is particularly relevant when adapted to country context to maximize each agency's complementary capacities and strengths. Over recent years, significant efforts have been made to enhance RBA collaboration. This progress must be strengthened for effective SDG 2 results. As noted in the RBA paper on Collaboration among the United Nations Rome-based Agencies: Delivering on the 2030 Agenda, WFP is committed to working with FAO and IFAD by capturing all available synergies and complementarities and avoiding overlaps to contribute to collective results across humanitarian and development contexts, and to enhance RBA advocacy on food security and nutrition at the global level and within the broader United Nations system.   Planning and implementation of WFP's country-level activities with UNDS partners, especially FAO and IFAD, will continue to be a priority for achieving zero hunger and avoiding programme overlap and duplication.

		"q6": "In the formulation of WFP's County Strategic Plans, national Zero Hunger Strategic Review (ZHSR) offer a common and comprehensive view of national food security and nutrition challenges and solutions, thus benefiting multiple stakeholders and potentially informing a range of other processes such as national development plans, UNDAFs, individual sectoral plans and Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs).   By participating and contributing to the ZHSR, a wide range of partners are enabled to anchor their strategic planning in a common, nationally owned framework for zero hunger. Convening key stakeholders around the table also raises awareness of the most pressing food security and nutrition bottlenecks and increases advocacy for a timely and comprehensive national response.   By highlighting the benefits of investing in hunger solutions and by elevating the issue on the national agenda, the ZHSR is an exceptional opportunity to bring together line ministries and strengthen a multi-sectoral approach to food security and nutrition which are often considered separate issues and hence scattered across various ministries. Ultimately, the process aims to foster synergies between the programmes of various partners, promote new partnerships and enhance coordination.  WFP consultations with its Executive Board's Membership have been key in guiding WFP's strategic direction and system changes.

The conference brought together a wide and diverse group of humanitarian supply chain practitioners. Over 150 supply chain delegates attended the conference, with representatives from more than 70 Donors, UN agencies, Government bodies, Red Cross and Crescent agencies,  commercial companies and Universities. The delegates came together to provide East African responses to key issues that were raised by the Global Logistics Cluster in its paper ‘Delivering in a Moving World' at the World Humanitarian Summit, 2016.  Recommendations to address logistic challenges and strengthen supply chains were put forward as follows:   1. Strengthen local response  2. Assist through cash and in-kind  3. Allow access to beneficiaries in complex emergencies  4. Engage the private sector  5. Coordinate, collaborate and provide shared services  WFP and Help Logistics will again be co-hosting the 6th Africa Logistics conference this year on the 14th and 15th March in Nairobi, Kenya. The theme of the conference is ‘African Humanitarian Logistics until 2030' with the objective of bringing 120 participants from the humanitarian, government, donor, academic and private sector together to consider how humanitarian supply networks in Africa will evolve between now and 2030, when the Sustainable Development Goals deadline comes to an end.     South Sudan Substantive dialogue, co-convened by WFP an ECHO in December 2015     Co-convened by WFP and ECHO, this meeting was designed to help fill a gap in substantive dialogue focusing explicitly on the food and nutrition crisis, the related operational challenges and what more can be done to mitigate human suffering in what has become a protracted situation in South Sudan, and to identify priorities and opportunities for food assistance efforts in the next one to three years.     More than ninety participants took part in the meeting, which took place from 10-11 December in Nairobi. These included senior participants from the UN and other international organizations, South Sudan civil society organizations, religious leaders, think-tanks and academia, the private sector and donors as well as resource people from the media. Technical staff from the humanitarian branches of both the South Sudanese government and the opposition also participated.      Recommendations for humanitarian actors included:    1. Be more creative in telling our stories by focusing on the South Sudanese people themselves rather than on abstract concepts of vulnerability and need. This may require taking a more positive approach to storytelling and reflecting the diversity that exists in the country. Where appropriate, bring stories closer to home for the reader by emphasizing partnerships (i.e. link media interest in the US to how USAID is assisting).   2. Provide appropriate context. Many of the stories that are told about South Sudan explain the violence in the country as ‘senseless', with faceless, nameless perpetrators and focus narrative on the victims because it's seen as a ‘safer' story. There must be a greater emphasis on conveying the true nature of what is happening, acknowledging that people have an independent mind and spirit and are often fighting because of deeply held beliefs. Without a more nuanced understanding of the war, it is difficult to see how peace might be achieved.   3. Be sensitive to unintended consequences of our narratives. Focusing on people, personal efforts to solve problems, and reflecting real voices of the people we serve, can not only counter stereotypes but provide a more compelling narrative for mobilizing support.   4. Harness the knowledge of local journalists and build their capacity to tell better stories, including by helping them to function as agents of accountability and as a channel to provide regular citizens with a voice. Recognize that South Sudanese journalists may have important roles in publishing and promoting stories of reconciliation that may not suit international media.   5. Work hard to find ways to convey technical information (e.g. about food security) better so that the story does not always focus on famine.   6. Push for access and avoid self-censorship. It is important to continue to cover and push for coverage of critical issues    Healthy-Not-Hungry Dinners    Continuing a near decade-long tradition at the World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) hosted a dinner in Davos, Switzerland for the 2017 WEF Annual meeting. In 2017, WFP partnered with Project Everyone to host a dinner around the SDGs. The dinner served as a launching pad for a year-long movement, called #HealthyNotHungry, which aimed to raise awareness around Zero Hunger and the Global Goals more generally.    In the lead-up to the flagship dinner, WFP hosted a series of about 20 satellite dinners around the world in major capitals. The dinners focused largely on healthy and sustainable food systems and served as the first step in a larger movement. As such, the key element among the dinners was the menu which highlighted the value of locally sourced and nutritious foods. The menus were developed by a roster of international chefs committed to sustainable food systems and the achievement of a Zero Hunger world. Each chef was asked to create a unique meal. Their challenge was to prepare dishes anchored in the four staples (wheat, maize, rice, and potatoes) but to also include ingredients from the 29,996 other edible plant species not regularly consumed by the global population.    One of the approximately two dozen dinners held world-wide was held by WFP Southern Africa regional Bureau in Johannesburg in January 2017. The event engaged senior public figures from the Southern Africa region, advocates and key stakeholders for action on the SDGs, particularly SDG2 and SDG3. The event proved to be a successful launch-pad for a number of new connections and partnerships between WFP and new stakeholders, including the World Economic Forum's Global Shapers, South Africa's Agricultural Research Council, National Planning Commission and Centre for Food, Nutrition and Well Being. The event engaged national radio, food authors, critics and journalists from a variety of agencies for pre- and post-event media. Advocacy dialogue was structured around the topic of the importance of healthy and sustainable food systems for all, and the importance of protecting and securing local, healthy and nutritious foods and encouraging the consumption of a more diversified diet and the protection, production and consumption of other edible plant species beyond the 4 major staples which are globally consumed.    In addition to these dinners, WFP partnered with chefs around the world who were not able to host a #HealthyNotHungry dinner in the lead up to the WEF Annual Meeting. Instead, these \"satellite chefs\" showed solidarity with this global movement by including items on their menus that speak to this concept in the lead up to WEF.       Shock-Responsive Social Protection: Towards a Resilient Malawi  High-Level Panel – 6th October 2016 – Ufulu Gardens, Lilongwe    As Malawi faced successive and concurrent shocks driving the historic emergency response over the 2016/7 lean season leading to some 6.5 million Malawians in need of emergency food assistance, WFP and partners continue strengthening social protection systems to reduce chronic need and better equip Malawi to address the shocks driving annual food and nutrition insecurity. This is being achieved through linking the social protection sector to humanitarian systems and actors, a concept termed ‘shock responsive social protection'.    In late 2016, the Government of Malawi and the World Food Programme (WFP) hosted a national conference on ‘Shock Responsive Social Protection' (SRSP), in Lilongwe, Malawi. The conference was attended by experts from all over the world including organizations such as: Oxford Policy Management (OPM); Development Pathway; Institute of Development Studies (IDS); UN agencies, as well as from the relevant Malawi Government ministries and Departments. Over 90 participants from across Malawi and globally came to listen to the panellists and discuss how to strengthen social protection systems to reduce chronic food insecurity and to better equip Malawi to address shocks driving annual food and nutrition insecurity.    Building on the conclusions of the high-level panel discussions during the conference, the concept of shock-responsive-social protection is now being advanced through a study co-commissioned by WFP, GIZ, and the World Bank as well as through operational trials undertaken by the Overseas Development Institute and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in 2017.  On the ground in Malawi, and as a result of this conference, WFP supported activities such as trialing the use of the social registry to target households for emergency food assistance, and supporting the roll out of ‘automatic inclusion' – automatically enrolling social cash transfer beneficiaries under the ongoing social protection programme into the emergency food assistance programs. In addition, under the 2017 emergency response, WFP worked with partners to scale up Emergency School Meals to reach school-going children in shock-affected areas, automatically including Social Cash Transfer beneficiaries, and supporting those with labour capacity in building productive assets during the emergency response and transitioning them to WFP's Food-for-Assets (FFA) programme, thus bridging the relief-recovery-resilience continuum. Some of the lessons, insights and findings have been incorporated into the Malawi national Resilience Plan as well as in Malawi's 5-year Social Protection Plans.",

In WFP's view, UN efforts – and therefore UN Reform – must be guided by a clear and comprehensive system-wide strategic logic in order to ensure that reforms within the different workstreams are consistent, coherent, and mutually reinforcing. The System-wide Strategic Framework must be guided by the principle that country level efforts are the key to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The measure of success is progress on the ground against the SDG targets and indicators, recognizing that the SDGs are the ‘results framework' against which UN system efforts will be measured.   The UN System's four functional pillars -- development, human rights and the rule of law, peace and security, and humanitarian response -- structure the UN's unique contribution to country efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda. In this context, achieving the 2030 Agenda involves two fundamental challenges. On the one hand, it is necessary to take actions that will advance and enable progress towards achieving the SDGs. On the other hand, it is essential to take actions that address and/or contain the threats and hindrances to achieving progress on the SDGs.

This was a testament that the World Bank Group (WBG) was to support the 2030 Agenda by tackling the FfD agenda, as the Means of Implementation to the SDGs.     Following the paradigm shift proposed in the Billions to Trillions narrative, the WBG 2015 Annual Meetings in Lima, the Development Committee discussion set the tone for our institution's work towards implementation of the SDGs in the document \"WBG Support for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\" Further, in 2016, a strategy paper, the \"Forward Look – a Vision for the World Bank Group in 2030,\" set a common view among our shareholders on how to best support the development agenda for 2030; it also connects the Bank Group's institutional vision to the SDGs. The Forward Look encourages commitments and policies toward the global public goods agenda while (i) prioritizing private sector solutions before deploying scarce public resources, including for infrastructure; (ii) strengthening domestic resource mobilization; (iii) assisting all Bank Group clients, including low-income and middle-income countries; (iv) encouraging agility and results-focused work across the public and private sectors; and (v) paying attention to stabilizing the economy and supporting growth in situations of fragility, conflict and violence, as well as to the development needs of small states.      The Bank Group has set two goals for the world to achieve by 2030: ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. These goals need to be pursued in a sustainable manner: socially, economically, and environmentally.  We will achieve them in three ways:     1.\tPromoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, especially by helping countries create jobs and boost private investment in infrastructure.  2.	Investing in human capital, including early childhood development; equal opportunities in education, health, and training; and acquisition of job skills: areas that can make the biggest difference in countries' ability to grow and compete over the long term.   3.	Fostering resilience to global shocks and threats that could roll back development gains, by helping countries develop resilient infrastructure, invest in disaster risk preparedness, prepare for and respond to pandemics, and cope with forced migration.     Through our country engagement instruments, the WBG has taken several steps to align our work to the 2030 Agenda. This includes Country Partnership Frameworks and the new Environmental and Social Framework, which promotes inclusive development and aims to leave no one behind.     Further, the Bank Group Corporate Scorecards, which were endorsed in April 2014 to monitor the implementation of the Bank Group Strategy, are aligned with the 2030 Agenda. The Bank Group has assessed the strategic alignment of the SDGs' targets and indicators with the Bank Group's corporate results frameworks and the Results Measurement System (RMS) for the International Development Association (IDA). Starting in July 2017, new frameworks will take the SDGs into account in the Bank Group's business planning and monitoring. The Scorecards and IDA18 RMS will be consistent with and fully reflect the spirit of the SDGs while maintaining the ability to serve specific needs in monitoring the Bank Group's performance.    Based on the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action, the WBG has embarked on an effort to help countries maximize finance for development, and to do so responsibly without pushing the public sector into unsustainable levels of debt and contingent liabilities. This will entail pursuing private sector solutions where they can help achieve development goals, and reserving scarce public finance for where it is most needed. This approach builds on the Principles of MDBs Strategy for Crowding in Private Sector Finance for Growth and Sustainable Development (the \"Hamburg Principles\") and the Joint MDB Statement of Ambitions for Crowding in Private Finance, which commit MDBs to collectively increase private financing mobilized by 25-35 percent over the next three years.    This includes changes to the latest replenishment to the International Development Association (IDA), as a bold paradigm shift in how it mobilizes finance to support a significant policy package to help IDA clients achieve their development goals. It was the largest replenishment in IDA's 56-year history - approximately $75 billion- and heralds a significant step change in its policy and financing framework.

The plan also offers assistance to governments on disruptive and \"over the horizon\" technologies like the Internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and drones in support of development goals.   •	The World Bank Group is working with governments to reach their objectives for Goal 7 (Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all) which requires a concerted push on scaling up renewable technologies.  Some examples of our recent investments are: in India, the Bank provided $ 1 billion in lending for solar projects; and in China, $ 80 million was invested in a clean stove project, which provided 6 million clean stoves to the Hebei Province.    •	The Bank Group is accelerating efforts to expand access to electricity, by scaling up investments in both on- and off-grid solutions. The goal is to add 20 GW of renewable energy generation over five years and mobilize $25 billion in commercial funds for clean energy. In Africa alone, the Bank Group has committed to helping develop 5 GW of grid-connected solar energy projects and to providing 55 million off-grid consumers with modern energy services by 2026.  •	STI Forum: The World Bank Group is a member of the Interagency Task Team on Science, Technology and Innovation for the SDGs.

Below are some examples of how the organization works with these organizations:    •\tHigh-Level Panel on Water:  The World Bank Group President and UN Secretary General convened a high-level panel consisting of 11 sitting Heads of States and a Special Advisor.  The Bank Group is actively engaged and committed to contributing to the achievement of SDG 6 and all the SDGs that rely on water.     •	Partnership with the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Program: The Bank Group is the custodian agency for SDG indicators 6.1 (on drinking water) and 6.2 (on sanitation and hygiene); both of these define a \"safely managed\" service level. The Bank Group is also working with various UN partners to define methodologies and collaborate on data gathering for the proposed indicators.  •	The UN and the Bank Group have produced a joint flagship publication, Prevention of Violent Conflict/Pathways to Peace, that aims to improve understanding of how domestic policymaking and endogenous dynamics interact with development assistance, security, political, and human rights tools, to prevent conflict from becoming violent (SDG 16). The study has a strong focus on gender equality and on violence against women and children in crisis situations. It will identify ways that international assistance tools can shift local dynamics to reduce the risk of conflict.  •	The Bank Group and the UN also jointly support implementation of the humanitarian-development, peace, nexus, bringing together key elements of the Agenda for Humanity and UN resolutions of sustaining peace with the Bank Group's strong development engagement and implementation capacity in situations of fragility, conflict, and violence. The Bank Group launched Humanitarian-Development-Peace Initiative in northeast Nigeria in March 2017 to accelerate the delivery of a $775 million package of operations for early recovery and livelihood support in the region. That grant will pilot a new way of working with humanitarian, development, and peace actors to tackle an elevated risk of famine in a complex and multidimensional subnational crisis.   •	In April 2017, the Bank Group and the UN signed a partnership framework on building resilience and sustaining peace that encourages greater collaboration between the institutions and promotes work to reduce multidimensional risks of crisis and help prevent violent conflict. It will also develop joint analysis and tools, coordinate support to address protracted crises, and scale up impact by leveraging financing.  •	The MDBs convened the Global Infrastructure Forum in April 2016 to coordinate global efforts to reduce the infrastructure gap and achieve the objectives of SDG 9 on innovation and infrastructure. At the Forum's second gathering in April 2017, the MDBs agreed to extend their collaboration to overcome upstream constraints and mobilize additional infrastructure investment and finance from the private sector. The MDB's are moreover working on a set of principles to guide MDB's strategy for crowding-in private sector finance for growth and sustainable development.  •	The Bank Group is collaborating with the WHO to strengthen efforts in monitoring UHC at the global level. The two institutions have developed a global UHC database that is currently going through a country consultation process.  In addition, the International Health Partnership for UHC 2030 provides a multi-stakeholder platform to strengthen collaboration and contribute to resilient, sustainable and equitable health systems, which are key to achieving universal health coverage and global health security by 2030. The Bank Group and WHO co-host its secretariat.  •	The WBG is working jointly with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs to determine the value of creating a new transport entity meant to help coordinate the various activities in the sector throughout the UN system. This work may lead to the creation of a new inter-agency coordination mechanism and builds from the recommendations outlined in the SG's report on sustainable transport in 2016.   Participation in any of the following coordination system wide mechanisms or any other relevant platform - CEB, UNDG, EC-ESA Plus, RCMs, UN-Energy, UN-Water, UN-Ocean, IAEG, IATT  •	CEB:  The World Bank Group participates in the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB).  •	UNDG: Participation in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) -UNDG Steering Committee on Famine Response and Prevention in North-East Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.  The IASC-UNDG Steering Committee is co-chaired by the ERC and the Chair of the UNDG / UNDP Administrator. It further comprises FAO, IOM, UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP, WHO, and the World Bank.  •	ECESA Plus: The World Bank Group participates in ECESA Plus Principals meetings such as the meetings on the Follow-up to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  •	RCMs: World Bank Group country offices participate and engage directly with UN offices on the ground, including engagements with RCMs.  •	UN-Energy: The World Bank Group is a member of UN-Energy and participates in UN-Energy engagements and initiatives.    •	UN-Water: The World Bank Group is a member of UN-Water and participates in UN-Water engagements and initiatives.    •	UN-Ocean: The World Bank Group is a member of UN-Ocean and participates in UN-Ocean engagements and initiatives.    •	IAEG:  The World Bank Group actively participates in the IAEG and is a custodian agency to provide data for many of the SDG indicators.    •	IATT: The World Bank Group is a member of the Inter-agency Task Team.  •	IATF: The World Bank Group is an institutional stakeholder of the IATF and actively participates in meetings, events and providing technical input for the IATF report.

		"q6": "The Bank Group recognizes that a central tenet of the SDGs is partnership at the global, regional, and country levels. Hence the Bank Group is providing a platform for coordinated action. Partnership is one of our key pillars of support for the SDGs. The Bank Group is involved in numerous global partnerships across different stakeholders:   •\tPrivate Sector:  The Bank Group has numerous partnerships with private sector entities which advance the SDGs in all regions.  These range from financial institutions that are co-investors in projects, to health industry partners delivering health and medical services, to insurance providers responding to natural disasters, to banks issuing special World Bank bonds (green bonds, SDG bonds, etc.).    •	Local governments and mayors: The Bank Group works closely with municipalities and local government administrators and mayors to advance development goals.  Specifically, the organization has worked with Mayors to advance the dialogue on the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals through knowledge sharing events and exchanges.     •	Civil society: The Bank interacts with hundreds of CSOs every day throughout the world, engaging with them through information sharing, policy dialogue, strategy consultation, operational collaboration, and institutional partnerships.  There are over 120 professionals in the Bank's Washington, DC Headquarters, and in over 100 country offices, that act as Civil Society Focal Points responsible for engaging CSOs from the local to the global levels.   •	Foundations:  The WBG has partnerships with over 100 foundations around the world. We work with well-established global leaders, younger philanthropies testing new approaches, corporate foundations, social entrepreneurs, and small, local community foundations. Our partnerships cover a broad range of priorities, from proving health care systems to managing depleted freshwater resources, supporting women's economic empowerment to training teachers and designing green cities.  •	Academia:  The Bank Group has long-standing relationships with academic institutions and specifically universities.  World Bank Group experts have engaged more recently with universities to host lectures and seminars on the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.    •	Youth:  The World Bank Group and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School, launched Ideas for Action, as a knowledge platform connecting young leaders all around the world who are passionate about the future development of our world.  We host an annual competition during which youths from around the world design ideas for financing the 2030 Agenda. The competition acts as a catalyst to spark global conversation among millennials and seeks to encourage them to contribute their own voice to the development conversation  ",

Regarding finance, the WBG (and other MDBs) will ensure that public and private investments are complementary and based on the Hamburg Principles adopted during the last G20 Summit. These principles essentially outline how the MDBs will help countries scale up their development resources by drawing appropriately on private sector solutions where these can boost growth for the poorest and most vulnerable. For the Bank Group, this includes an effort that brings together IDA, IFC, and MIGA to mobilize private investment and create markets in the most challenging environments.   Regarding data, the WBG has three main areas of work: strengthening partnerships, producing data and cross-country indicators, and fostering client country data production, dissemination, and use. This includes technical assistance on household survey programs and poverty mapping, inputs to the SDG indicator negotiations and custodian agency for several indicators (including SDG 1.1 on poverty), supporting the World Development Indicators and building the annual SDG Atlas, and working with partners, such as UNHCR on establishing a joint data center on forced displacement to improve statistics on refugees, and with Eurostat on producing international purchasing power parity estimates.   Regarding implementation, the WBG twin goals are supported by three areas of investment: human investment, inclusive growth, and resilience.",

SHAA2030 builds on the Pan American Health Organization's (PAHO) Health Agenda for the Americas 2008-2017, unfinished business from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the uniqueness of the 2030 Agenda. It represents the highest-level policy and strategic planning framework for the Region and serves as a call to action for Member States to work to achieve a healthier and more equitable Region of the Americas, as envisioned by the SDGs.  This Agenda will be implemented through PAHO strategic plans and strategies, as well as through sub-regional and national health plans.  •	The Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO/PAHO) is currently considering a Strategy and Roadmap developed to help guide Member States in implementing actions to realize the SDGs.  Based on the key principles of equity and sustainability, the institutional strategy uses innovation and multi-sectoral approaches to incorporate other sectors as partners. The Roadmap will lead to better inter-programmatic collaboration and coordination between programs and the SDG targets they address, particularly those related to health. It will also help establish a unified regional response, optimize national and regional development efforts, and avoid duplication, waste and multiple reporting structures that place an undue burden on Member States. Ultimately, the Roadmap maintains a central focus on country needs and priorities, as opposed to a broad-brush regional approach, and will require Country Cooperation Strategies (CCSs) to include health and health-related SDG targets at the national level. This is in-keeping with the new global CCS Guidelines from the WHO.  •	Executive staff, including AMRO's Director, took part in the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development in April 2017 (Mexico), in which countries in the Americas took stock of the progress made on the SDGs.  The Regional Forum has been set up by Member States of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean to systematically monitor and report on progress and challenges concerning implementation of the SDGs.   •	AMRO is currently conducting Regional consultations on its Strategy and Plan of Action on Health Promotion within the Context of the SDGs, which seeks to specifically align AMRO's and the Region's Health Promotion programming with the 2030 Agenda, both in terms of priorities and in terms of modes of multi-sectoral programming.  This Strategy and Plan of Action incorporates four strategic lines of action explicitly focused on bringing together the tools of Health Promotion and the vision of the 2030 Agenda:  •	Revitalizing the Healthy Settings Approach with a particular focus on local action  •	Strengthening partnerships and participation through good governance  •	Adopting health literacy for equity and empowerment  •	Reorienting health services (prioritizing both UHC and determinants of health)  •	In 2017, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe, at its 67th session endorsed the Roadmap to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, building on Health 2020, the European policy for health and well-being. The roadmap aims to strengthen the capacities of Member States, to achieve better, more equitable, sustainable health and well-being for all at all ages in the WHO European Region. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires working in a transformative way in order to implement a set of coherent, evidence-informed policies that address health, well-being and all their determinants throughout the life-course and across all sectors of government and society. Revitalized global and regional partnerships are essential and will provide the essential support and momentum to this joint societal and global effort. This roadmap proposes five interdependent strategic directions: advancing governance and leadership for health and well-being; leaving no one behind; preventing disease and addressing health determinants by promoting multi- and intersectoral policies throughout the life-course; establishing healthy places, settings and resilient communities; and strengthening health systems for universal health coverage . It proposes four enabling measures to advance the implementation of both the 2030 Agenda and Health 2020: investment for health; multi-partner cooperation; health literacy, research and innovation; monitoring and evaluation.   •	The WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) as a follow-up provides support to its Member States in partnership and promotes the progressive alignment of health and development policies or plans;  the achievement of directly and indirectly health-related SDGs and their targets; the use of existing networks and platforms to ensure dialogue between organizations, sectors and countries; and  the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the SDGs. Priorities for the Regional Office will include pursuing the implementation of both the 2030 Agenda and Health 2020 coherently in its work and with individual countries; technical support to countries; its contribution to coordination among United Nations agencies; stronger partnerships and initiatives at the regional and subregional levels; and evidence-informed monitoring and reporting.  •	The 67th session of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific adopted resolution WPR/RC67.R5 on \"Sustainable Development Goals\" in October 2016, endorsing the Regional Action Agenda on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Western Pacific.   •	The action agenda suggests options for Member States to consider in making the transition from the MDGs to the SDGs based on country-specific contexts, resources and entry points and related WHO support.  It suggests practical actions to achieve the change in mindset that is needed for achieving the SDGs, including new ways of working that go beyond business as usual – and newer roles and capabilities for the health sector in working across government and stakeholders.   •	The action agenda builds on and aligns with existing global and regional strategies, World Health Assembly and Regional Committee resolutions, as well as broader United Nations mandates and guidance. The regional action framework on Universal Health Coverage: Moving Towards Better Health (WPR/RC66.R2) provides the basis for country-wise development of UHC implementation roadmaps. UHC is the platform that brings together various health and development efforts.  •	More recently, the SDGs have also informed further agenda items of the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific and related regional frameworks in specific programme areas, for example on urban health (2015), health and the environment (2016), health promotion and the SDGs (2017) and law reform in the SDGs (2018, tbc). A progress item on the SDGs in follow up to WPR/RC67.R5 is also expected to be scheduled for 2018.

Current adjustments are ongoing in the development of national roadmaps, building on the European roadmap. 93% of European Member States adjusted their national health policies to Health 2020. Integrating equity, gender and human rights and addressing the social and environmental determinants of health into multisectoral work is an effort that WHO/EURO have undertaken since many years.   •	Normative instruments:   o	A number of normative instruments on climate, environment and health (e.g. air quality and noise guidelines) in coordination with WHO Headquarters (HQ) and coordinated or contributed to research and innovation on the social, economic and environmental determinants; and developed evidence-based policies for national or sub-national action. Mapping of WHO instruments.   •	A mapping exercise of World Health Assembly, Regional Committee and other resolutions, strategies and action plans  was conducted to assess the legal and policy instruments available to support the implementation of health-related SDG targets and goals. This exercise led to the creation of two databases (one related to SDG 3 targets and one focused on health in all other SDGs).  •	Governance. Governance is also a cross-cutting issue of the SDG roadmap Health 2020 and SDG implementation is supported through four approaches: intersectoral action for health, whole-of-government, Health in All Policies, and governance for health, all of which are underpinned by a whole-of-society approach. These approaches focus on how best to engage key stakeholders, including communities, citizens and businesses in policy implementation, while maintaining a focus on health as a social, environmental, cultural and economic goal.   •	Producing a resource kit for Member States. Following a request from Member States, EURO is developing a resource kit for Member States, building on material developed across the organization. This resource kit in particular should support the Member States in getting started, in integrating health and well-being into national and subnational development plans, support to implementation, monitoring and evaluation.   •	SDG health targets factsheets. SDG factsheets have been created to synthesize the evidence-base on key health targets in order to promote coherence and better address the burden of disease throughout the Region. Currently, SDG factsheets  have been produced on communicable and noncommunicable disease (NCD), climate change, road safety, vaccine coverage, antimicrobial resistance, essential medicines, hazardous chemicals, sexual and reproductive health services, mental health, maternal health, child and adolescent health and migration and health and others are under development. It was agreed that these factsheets present important information and should be included in the technical annex.  •	In line with the Regional Action Agenda on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the Western Pacific, there has been strong commitment and senior management leadership to facilitate the mindset change implied by the SDGs also within the WHO Western Pacific Region.  For example, the SDGs were the topic of two Consultations of WHO Representatives and Country Liaison Officers in the Western Pacific Region (April and November 2016).  •	The SDGs and UHC also call for stronger coordination and collaboration across different health programme areas and teams. WPRO has set up two cross-divisional working groups to foster collaboration on (1) MDG/SDGs and (2) Gender and Social Determinants.  •	The medium-term strategic vision for cooperation between WHO and individual countries is represented in the WHO country cooperation strategies (CCS).  All CCSs developed in the Western Pacific Region since 2016 have explicitly recognized the importance of the SDGs, and the SDGs have been specifically considered during the formulation of the strategic priorities with each country.  •	Formulation of the two year programme of collaboration with countries, identifying specific activities that WHO will support during that period, are then formulated taking into account the priorities of the CCS.

In addition to facilitating peer-to-peer learning across regions, RHN produces publications to share knowledge and best practices, undertakes capacity building activities, gives voice and provides direct exposure to key stakeholders at the sub-national level, and supports communications activities to enhance awareness and visibility on the ground. The European Healthy Cities Network currently consists of 1,400 cities in 30 countries, with 96 WHO flagship-designated cities in total. The Network was founded in 1988 and is preparing to enter its seventh phase, which will be aligned with the 2030 Agenda and guided by the five ‘Ps' of sustainable development plus one : people, planet, peace, prosperity, and participation + place. The network is also preparing for its first political summit of mayors to be held in Copenhagen in February 2018. Together, these networks expand the entry points available to WHO in countries.  o	In particular, Wales has become an exemplar of SDG localization through the passage and implementation of the Well-being of Future Generations Act, adopted in 2015. In particular, the Welsh case demonstrates the importance of extensive consultation, including over 6,500 individuals, at the local level in order to fully embed and engender a sense of ownership over health-related SDG attainment on the ground. The Welsh strategy is organized around seven well-being goals (a globally responsible, prosperous, resilient, healthier, and more equal Wales with more cohesive communities and vibrant culture and thriving Welsh Language) and five ways of working, including a focus on the long-term, prevention, integration, collaboration and involvement. To assist with implementation, the development of a Health and Sustainability Hub is underway along with a toolkit to support Sustainability Improvement for Teams (SIFT), which is being developed to support the five ways of working through a participatory, iterative development process.  o	Some key examples in AMRO include:  o	Chile: In order to implement the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, Chile has worked to ensure that the Goals are well integrated into national policies and plans. For example, Chile has developed a National Council comprised of the Minister of External Affairs, Minister of Tourism, Minister of Social Development and Minister of the Environment. Currently, the Council is completing a national analysis on the 17 SDGs and actions needed to achieve them. The analysis includes progress, areas for improvement and challenges.   o	Costa Rica: Since 2015, Costa Rica has made significant efforts to articulate a multidimensional approach to the implementation of SDGs. In 2016, Costa Rica became the first country to sign a \"National Pact for the Achievement of Sustainable Development Goals,\" representing a fundamental consensus to ‘leave no one behind'.  Signatories included representatives from three government branches, civil society organizations, faith based organizations, public universities, local governments and the business sector.    o	Jamaica: In Jamaica, the adoption of the Agenda has resulted in a review of national development processes in order to maximize synergies between the global agenda and Jamaica's national development plan, \"Vision 2030 Jamaica – National Development Plan\", adopted in 2009. Vision 2030, Jamaica's first long-term development plan, provides a strategic road map to prepare the country for achieving developed country status by 2030. The plan aims to foster sustainable prosperity by creating conditions in which the country's productive enterprises are able to generate greater levels of wealth and in which the social and environmental conditions and the general well-being of the society are enhanced.   o	Peru: In September 2016, Peru began updating national policies, incorporating the guidelines of the 2030 Agenda within sector-specific policies and plans.

Endemic measles interrupted in 42 out of 53 countries in the Region26-09-2017  The number of countries in the Region that have demonstrated interruption of measles and rubella continues to increase and now stands at 42 for measles and 37 for rubella. However, Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe, warns that immunization coverage is decreasing. 1 in every 15 children still does not receive the first vaccination dose against measles and rubella on time.  European leaders set new roadmap to achieve 2030 Agenda and improve 900 million people's health and well-being07-09-2017  Health leaders gather at the annual meeting of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe. In Budapest, Hungary on 11–14 September 2017 they will take decisions on health priorities that will have an impact on the health and well-being of about 900 million people in the WHO European Region, including in the European Union, central and eastern Europe, the Caucasus and central Asia.  Regional Committee: making decisions on key health priorities for the European Region 29-08-2017  On 11 September 2017 in Budapest, Hungary, health ministers and high-level representatives of the 53 Member States of the WHO European Region, along with partner organizations and civil society, will gather for the annual WHO Regional Committee for Europe. The committees provide an opportunity to discuss and make decisions related to key health priorities in the Region. In this year's 67th session, and in alignment with the Health 2020 policy framework and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, participants will consider topics ranging from building a sustainable health workforce to improving the environment and health.  Health sector leading the way on adapting SDGs in Kyrgyzstan08-06-2017  With support from WHO and other development partners, the Ministry of Health of Kyrgyzstan has become an active leader in setting priorities and adapting the SDGs to make implementation possible at the national level.  Better future: Health for all, all for health 19-05-2017  In September 2015, heads of state and government adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The United Nations emphasizes that everyone needs to play their part if the SDGs are to be reached: governments, the private sector and civil society. The 17 SDGs and their 169 associated targets are global in nature, universally applicable and interlinked. Health has a central place as a major contributor and beneficiary of sustainable development policies. SDG 3, \"Health and well-being for all\", is strengthened by the 13 health targets, and additional health-related targets are set out under other goals.  Reducing the SDG reporting burden: WHO/Europe's initiative presented at the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development 09-05-2017  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development underscores the importance of \"quality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggregated data … to help with the measurement of progress and to ensure that no one is left behind\" (Paragraph 48). Improving the collection, coordination, analysis and dissemination of data and building statistical capacities for monitoring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remain significant challenges for all countries in the WHO European Region and beyond.  WHO Regional Director for Europe highlights key health aspects for SDG implementation at the first Regional Forum on Sustainable Development 03-05-2017  The first Regional Forum on Sustainable Development for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Region took place in Geneva on 25 April 2017. The meeting was intended to follow up on and review progress towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the region. The Forum, which will be held annually, is designed to provide input from the UNECE region to the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), which oversees follow-up and review processes at the global level.  WHO European Healthy Cities Network adopts the Pécs Declaration14-03-2017  The WHO European Healthy Cities Network Annual Conference drew to a close on Friday 3 March, with mayors and political leaders adopting the 2017 Healthy Cities Pécs Declaration. This reconfirms their commitment to creating inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable societies.  First meeting of the Health and SDGs Expert Working Group provides input to roadmap for healthand sustainable development in the Region25-01-2017  In 2016, countries of the WHO European Region recognized that the Health 2020 policy framework and related World Health Assembly and Regional Committee resolutions provide a strong foundation upon which to position health at the centre of initiatives to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The WHO Regional Committee for Europe also endorsed the development of a roadmap to support countries in this endeavour.  Kick-off meeting of UN European coalition on health identifies 4 workstreams for joint action13-01-2017  The UN European coalition on health is a coordination mechanism focusing on the achievement of SDG 3 – to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages – in the pan-European Region, and of the health-related targets present in other SDGs.  Communicating health and the Sustainable Development Goals: experiences from small countries of the WHO European Region01-11-2016  One of the 4 key action areas of WHO/Europe's small countries initiative is to support the implementation of Health 2020 by better engaging the media as a partner. Collaborating with the media to raise awareness of health issues, goals and targets is also critical to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which calls for the involvement of civil society, the private sector and individuals from every country in order to hold governments accountable and ensure progress.  Ministers endorse joint statement on climate change and health at high-level meeting of small countries12-10-2016  Today, health ministers and policy-makers from eight European countries endorsed a statement that commits them to joining efforts in protecting people's health from adverse effects of climate change. The Third High-level Meeting of Small Countries, which includes WHO European countries with a population of less than one million, took place in Monaco on 11–12 October 2016 to strengthen collaboration in tackling today's complex health challenges.    New European platform for partnerships across sectors, United Nations agencies and civil society 13-12-2016  The second day of the high-level conference Working together for better health and well-being focused on how to implement intersectoral and cross-governmental policies. A common observation among delegates was the need to identify and communicate co-benefits for sectors other than health in order to generate effective, sustainable partnerships. They agreed to establish a new platform to improve and implement collaboration.  •	.  •	The development of the action agenda was informed by a Member States meeting on achieving the SDGs in the Western Pacific in June 2016.

Beginning with SDG 2 on Zero Hunger, more specifically target 2 (b) which urges the reduction of distortions in agricultural markets. The WTO's Export Competition in Agriculture Decision reached at the Nairobi Ministerial Conference delivers on this target by prohibiting the use of export subsidies and other measures of equivalent effect. Similarly with SDG 3 on Good Health, an amendment to the WTO TRIPS Agreement entered into force will make it easier for developing countries to have a secure legal pathway to access affordable medicines in line with target 3 (b).  Also, for SDG 8, the WTO continues to be successful in mobilizing resources under the Aid for Trade initiative in line with target 8 (a).  To date almost USD 300 billion has been disbursed for aid-for-trade support, mainly in Asia (41.5 per cent) and Africa (38.7 per cent), with 27 per cent of the total going to LDCs. Continuing with SDG 10 regarding Reducing Inequality, the principle of the Special and Differential treatment continues to be a strong pillar of WTO rules and is reflected in all new agreements, as for example in the Trade Facilitation Agreement which has a whole section dedicated to very innovative Special and Differential Treatment provisions.  Finally, on SDG 14 concerning Life Below Water, at the WTO's Eleventh Ministerial Conference Members adopted a Ministerial Decision on Fisheries subsidies. Under this decision, members agreed to continue to engage constructively in the fisheries subsidies negotiations with a view to adopting an agreement by the next Ministerial Conference in 2019 on comprehensive and effective disciplines that prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, and eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing Members also re-committed to implementation of existing notification obligations under Article 25.3 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures thus strengthening transparency with respect to fisheries subsidies. While this obligation is not new, good faith, accurate and truthful notifications can improve the level of understanding on current subsidisation practices in the fishing sector by WTO Members.

The WTO has worked closely with UCTAD and ITC, in what it calls the Geneva trade hub, to provide support to members in their implementation of the 2030 Agenda and in monitoring progress towards its achievement. The WTO also provides content on the Sustainable Development Goals indicators website which contributes to the annual report.  In collaboration with UNCTAD and ITC, the overhauling of the MDG-trade.org website is in the works and should be relaunched as SDG-trade.org. This website will allow for the easy tracking of progress towards the different trade-related targets of the SDGs and also allow any agency that uses it to generate their own statistics.  Partnership with the World Bank and IMF has also produced publications on the role of trade in ending poverty and making trade an engine of growth for all.  WTO also participates regularly at meetings of the CEB and its subsidiary bodies in particular the HLCP. The WTO participates very actively to the different CEB led initiatives in the framework of the wider UN system response to the SDGs implementation.  ",

		"q9": "Any strategic plan for the UN system to deliver on the 2030 Agenda needs to mainstream trade at the multilateral and national level. Because of its special role in sustainable development, more and more governments are adopting strategies which aim to mainstream trade into their national sustainable development strategies. The broad links of trade to other sectors, and the fact that plans and investments are most often driven and owned by non-trade specific stakeholders, require that trade policies and mechanisms need to be effectively mainstreamed into national as well as specific sector sustainable development plans. Such an approach ensures that all stakeholders act coherently in the use of trade as a proactive tool in achieving poverty reduction and fulfilling other SDGs. Therefore, trade needs to be mainstreamed at the levels of policy, institutions and resourcing; this could help countries achieve a range of SDG targets, including those that relate to participation in international trade, decent work and sustainable economic growth, reducing poverty, and strengthening environmental protection.    This strategic plan should also work towards strengthening the Multilateral Trading System since despite recent successes the system needs to continue delivering results in order to correct existing imbalances and adapt to the changing nature of international trade. There remains work to do to eliminate all restrictions and distortions in agricultural markets, continue improving market access in goods and services, including those which directly support the achievement of particular SDGs such as SDG:7 on clean and affordable energy or SDG:6 on clean water, and tackle other issues such as curbing subsidies that cause overfishing. WTO has already started this work and members are exploring possible measures in a range of areas. The ability of the trading system to continue support inclusive growth, jobs and poverty reduction depends on its continued strength. WTO members should therefore keep working to improve and strengthen the system, while also resisting protectionist policies. A strong trading system will be essential in delivering the SDGs, just as it was in delivering the MDGs.",
