"\n\t<p>Natural resources and infrastructure</p><p>During the 2016 Ministerial Meeting in the occasion of the ECLAC Governance Week on Natural Resources and Infrastructure (7-11 November 2016), the ministerial delegations of Latin America and the Caribbean adopted a series of recommendations on infrastructure governance, which emphasized the cross-cutting linkages between infrastructure and sustainable development and SDGs and identified the actions to be carried out to enhance the infrastructure governance in the region in line with the needs of the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>ECLAC capacity building workshops on national logistics and mobility policies, carried out in twelve Latin American and Caribbean countries, provided a methodology and tools to link these national policies to progress on the implementation of SDGs. ECLAC also intensified the work on reliable indicators on infrastructure to measure the progress on SDG 9, which resulted in a launch of INFRALATAM \u2013 a joint ECLAC/IDB/CAF portal offering information on the past and current infrastructure investment levels in the ECLAC region.</p><p>In 2016 ECLAC launched the regional dialogue on infrastructure governance, whose overarching goal is to create a multi-level and multi-stakeholder partnerships and platforms and promote the national and regional policies for infrastructure development in line with the needs of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.</p><p>Related to SDG 6, ECLAC has produced the studies \"Am\u00E9rica Latina y el Caribe hacia los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible en agua y saneamiento: Reformas recientes de las pol\u00EDticas sectoriales\" (LC/TS.2017/17, marzo de 2017, Serie Recursos Naturales e Infraestructura No. 180), \"El Nexo entre el agua, la energ\u00EDa y la alimentaci\u00F3n en Am\u00E9rica Latina y el Caribe: planificaci\u00F3n, marco normativo e identificaci\u00F3n de interconexiones prioritarias\" (LC/TS.2017/16, marzo de 2017, Serie Recursos Naturales e Infraestructura No. 179) and organized an expert group meeting entitled \u201CGobernanza del Nexo Agua, Energ\u00EDa y Alimentaci\u00F3n: Desaf\u00EDos de la Agenda 2030 en Agua y Saneamiento\u201D (Antigua, Guatemala, 6 al 7 de septiembre de 2016).</p><p>Beginning in February 2018, ECLAC will begin its Development Account project \"Regional Observatory on Renewable Energies - ROSE\" (2018-2021), whose primary objective will be to support the countries of the region in monitoring progress towards achievement of SDG7 (energy). Specific objectives include: i) creating solid national databases in the three sectors related to SDG7 (access, renewables, efficiency); ii) develop and interpret sectoral indicators to refine / adapt national policies for SDG7; iii) conduct \"capacity building\" of public officials in the collection, analysis and use of energy data to monitor progress towards SDG7; iv) create synergies and exchanges between the different national and regional stakeholders involved in the SDG7 process.</p><p>In 2017, ECLAC formulated a project for the UN Development Account named \u201CRural-Urban linkages for inclusive development policies in Colombia\u201D, which aims at moving forward towards the implementation of the Agenda in SDGs goals 8, 9, 11, 15 and 17. The project has a four-year implementation period (2018-2022).</p><p>Social Affairs</p><p>ECLAC provides technical assistance in social matters, as requested by governments, on a number of topics directly linked to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. Currently the main subjects addressed lately are social protection (El Salvador, Haiti, Paraguay and Paraguay), education and information technologies (Costa Rica) and the rights of persons with disabilities (Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico). Moreover the SDD has provided extensive assistance regarding the improvement of the measurement of public social spending to all governments, an essential means of implementation of the social dimension of the 2030 Agenda, allowing the development of a database on the subject (https://observatoriosocial.cepal.org/inversion/en). Some specific topics in which ECLAC conducts technical assistance and data capacity building related to the SDGs are disability, child labour, and child poverty.</p><p>Further, ECLAC implemented in 2016-2017 both analytical and knowledge sharing events aimed at mainstreaming themes of sustainable development in policies and sectoral strategies as they relate to international trade, published the book \u201CThe contribution of fair trade to sustainable development\u201D and co-organized a book launch seminar that brought together experts to present and discuss various country experiences in the region in relation to public policies oriented towards sustainable development. Also, to study the relationship between trade and sustainable development from a regional perspective, ECLAC published, \u201CEffects of an exogenous shock on trade on employment and wages of manufacturing companies in Colombia\u201D, which analyzes the impact on employment and wages at the company level of the negative shock in the exports of manufacturing firms from Colombia to Venezuela after the severance of diplomatic relations with that country at the end of 2008.</p><p>The Social Development Ministries and similar institutions of Latin America and the Caribbean are the main counterparts of ECLAC in the context of the Regional Conference of Social Development. Such entities need substantive technical and political support to fulfil complex tasks involving poverty eradication, fighting inequality and often have the mandate of implementing policies to improve the wellbeing and rights of specific population groups such as children, youth, the elderly, and persons with disabilities among others. In this context ECLAC has developed an extensive analysis of the programmatic and institutional framework of social policies in general (and social protection systems in particular) in order to promote their consolidation and coherence as an essential aspect to improve the effectiveness of social development policies. Also, ECLAC has been requested by governments of the region to further develop the analysis of the multiple manifestations of inequality and its effects. More specifically, several publications have addressed these aspects (The social inequality matrix in Latin America, Towards universal social protection: Latin American pathways and policy tools and Social Institutions in Latin America are recent examples). Also, several databases have been developed to provide stakeholders extensive information on these aspects (social pensions, conditional cash transfers, productive and employment inclusion programmes, social institutions and a Youth Observatory).</p><p>Financing for Development and Taxation</p><p>ECLAC has also produced significant analytical work related to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Latin America and the Caribbean, creating greater awareness of the Agenda in the region and policy options for countries to consider in crafting nationally appropriate development strategies. A major topic of concern in recent years as related to the 2030 Agenda has been the challenge of generating sufficient resources to finance sustainable development. To that end, in 2016 ECLAC launched the Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean 2016: 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the challenges of financing for development, which explored challenges to domestic resource mobilization in the region \u2013 with special focus on evasion arising from international operations by multinational enterprises and high net worth individuals \u2013 as well exploring external private sector financial flows, financial inclusion and innovation.</p><p>This work was further bolstered by the Fiscal Panorama of Latin America and the Caribbean 2017: Mobilizing resources to finance sustainable development which analyzed in depth issues relating to improving the progressivity of the tax system to tackle inequality, the adoption of environmental taxes to combat climate change, and fiscal policies to reduce territorial inequality in countries and strengthen sub-national public finances.</p><p>In the context of slow economic growth in Latin America, a key challenge for meeting the SDGs is the recovery of investment and growth. To that end, ECLAC has created knowledge and understanding among the region\u2019s policymakers about the characteristics of the current economic cycle, how it compares with previous cycles, and what are potential policy options for accelerating growth and investment with the aim to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth in line with the 2030 Agenda. The 2017 Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean, \u201CDynamics of the current economic cycle and policy challenges for boosting investment and growth\u201D, explored these issues in depth and was widely cited in the regional press.</p><p>ECLAC has also worked extensively on issues related to SDG 8, specifically in aspects related to technical and vocational education and training, and the protection of the unemployed and publishes jointly with ILO  bi-annual reports on key labour market topics for the region: recent editions examined the school-to-work transition of young people, the integration of migrants into Latin American labor markets, global value chains and employment in Latin America, rural-urban employment gaps, among others.</p><p>Moreover, ECLAC has sought to provide policymakers with data, cross-country/regional analysis, and policy options to tackle aspects of SDGs 10 and 17. ECLAC has also produced estimates of illicit financial flows (IFFs) due to the manipulation of international trade prices for the region, in line with the mandate included in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. ECLAC\u2019s analysis and policy advocacy for improving the region\u2019s tax structure to achieve greater equality has resonated in the region and has become a leitmotif in recent reforms.</p><p>To overcome the shortcomings of the income per capita as an ODA allocation approach, ECLAC has proposed a new perspective that can be complementary which we call the Structural Gap Approach. This approach identifies key structural obstacles that are holding back sustained, equitable and inclusive growth for middle income countries. It includes 12 additional indicators in terms of inequality and poverty, debt ratio, investment and saving, productivity and innovation, infrastructure, education, health, taxation, gender and the environment. ECLAC provided technical assistance to Costa Rica and worked with several of its ministries to draft the report Structural gap Approach. An analysis of the case of Costa Rica (LC/L.42765) was presented at a formal launch with key government officials. The document was coordinated by ECLAC and the Ministries of Planning and Foreign Relations of Costa Rica.</p><p>Further, the 2030 Agenda presents a unique opportunity to promote new instruments and innovative mechanisms for financing social and production development in Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201CGreen bonds\u201D are an example of alternative financial instruments becoming increasingly available to investors. New innovative securities are helping accomplish two goals: a) allocate funds to bridge the development gap and b) encourage investment in sustainable development projects that support environmental or ecologically-friendly causes. The drive towards green finance has been supported by two other underlying forces as well, one of a political and regulatory nature: the efforts unleashed by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the need to finance US$ 1 trillion a year in investments for renewable energy and other initiatives to limit global warming; and another market-driven: the increasing financial appeal of green investment, as clean technology matures and costs of installing solar and wind energy come down, erasing the need for subsidies.</p><p>Since the beginning of 2016, ECLAC has been monitoring the issuance of green bonds (as well as social and sustainable bonds) by Latin American and Caribbean issuers in international bond markets, for inclusion in the periodic report \u201CCapital Flows to Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201D A special section on green bond issuance has been added to the report since then. So far, six reports with a special section on green bonds were published in 2016 and 2017.</p><p>In addition, in October 2017 the report \u201CThe rise of green bonds: financing for development in Latin America and the Caribbean\u201D was published. This report examines the growing green bond market, with emphasis on Latin America and the Caribbean, showing that between 2014 and 2017 (as of August 31), the region issued US$ 8.4 billion in bonds with a green focus in local and international markets. The bulk of the region\u2019s green-focused bonds \u2013 US$ 7.1 billion (84%) \u2013 were issued in international markets. On average, these bonds represented only 1.6% of the total Latin American and Caribbean bond issuance in international markets in the period. In the first half of 2017, however, they accounted for 3.7% of the region\u2019s total international debt issuance. If this share continues on an upward trend, green bonds could play a more significant role in the mobilization of resources for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Latin American and the Caribbean. The strategy is to continue this line of research and work, looking to deepen the data and statistical capacity building with respect to green as well as sustainable bond issuance.</p><p>Climate Change</p><p>Technical assistance were provided to the Government of the Dominican Republic, represented by the National Council on Climate Change and the Clean Development Mechanism (CNCCMDL), in the preparation and discussion of the goals to be included in their INDCs. In particular, technical studies were prepared to calculate baselines of emissions and structural models to discuss the macroeconomic and distributive effects of climate change mitigation policies. These inputs were presented, discussed and adjusted during national workshops attended by the Ministries of Finance, Environment and Natural Resources, Economy, Planning and Development, among other institutions. The INDC was submitted to the UNFCCC by the Government and a roadmap was prepared for compliance, which includes inputs prepared during the technical assistance.</p>\n\t"
