The Montevideo Consensus on Population and Development –resulting from the first session of the Regional Conference on Population and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Montevideo in August, 2013– is the most important agreement among Governments signed in the region regarding Population and Development matters, and has become a key part of the review process of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and its follow up beyond 2014. This is clearly reflected in Resolution 2014/1 of the Commission on Population & Development of the United Nations which took note of the final documents arising from the regional conferences on population and development.   In response to the need of making the Consensus, an operational agenda, the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference decided, during its first meeting held in November 2014, to create an Operational guide for the implementation and follow-up of the Montevideo Consensus on Population and Development, and present it as its contribution to the second session of the Regional Conference, in Mexico City, October 2015. The Guide represented an initial effort  to create synergies with the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   Likewise, the second session of the Regional Conference decided to create an Ad Hoc Working Group in charge of preparing a proposal on indicators for the regional follow up of the Montevideo Consensus, taking into account those indicators defined for the SDGs. The final list of indicators, included in the final report of the working group, was approved during the extraordinary meeting of the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference, held in Santiago in November 2017 (See attached document, Informe Final Indicadores CRPD.pdf). It is important to highlight that nearly a third of the indicators included in the proposal correspond to SDGs. Thus, the regional follow up of the Montevideo Consensus has acquired a fundamental role in the monitoring process of the 2030 Agenda implementation in the region, in line with the resolution on the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, adopted during the thirty-sixth session of ECLAC in May 2016.  Therefore, the Regional Conference is a key component of the architecture for the implementation and follow-up of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Montevideo Consensus a valuable tool for advancing towards equality as promoted by ECLAC. The implementation and follow up of the Consensus shall reinforce the links between global and regional, promote cooperation among countries, and foster national capacity building, thus contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in the region.  For the XIII Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean (RCW), held in Montevideo in October 2016, ECLAC prepared the position document Equality and women's autonomy in the sustainable development agenda.The document presents a regional proposal on public policies ' potential to achieve substantive gender equality in the countries of the region within the framework of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. The document also proposes the mainstreaming of the gender perspective in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by cataloging the level of impact of each goal. The document was distributed among the countries and well received by different stakeholders participating at the XIII RCW. Its diagnosis and proposals were an input for the debates on gender equality and the 2030 Agenda at the national level after the RCW. At the XIII RCW governments agreed that the Regional Gender Agenda complements the SDG and is a guide for achieving sustainable development from the perspective of gender equality, rights and women's autonomy in Latin America and the Caribbean.As a result of the RCW, the governments adopted the Montevideo Strategyfor Implementation of the Regional Gender Agenda within the Sustainable Development Framework by 2030, a roadmapfor implementing the 2030 Agenda andfor designing policies and programmes to achieve sustainable development with gender equality.The Montevideo Strategy strengthens the means of implementation of the 2030 Agendafor Sustainable Development with measures in 10 implementation pillars with a view to ending discrimination against women, avoiding setbacks and moving towards substantive equality.Costa Rica as Vice - Chair of the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference on Women participated at the First meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development and delivered a presentation on the contribution of the RCW to the implementation of the 2030 Agendafor Sustainable Development and potential synergies and complementarities.During the Fifty - fifth Meeting of the Presiding Officers of the RCW, 14 countries reported on the application of the Montevideo Strategy at national level and its contribution to achieve SDG.Governments agreed to: \"Reaffirm the commitment to mainstream the gender perspective and women's autonomy and rights, in line with the Regional Gender Agenda and the Montevideo Strategy, into all the Sustainable Development Goals, their targets, indicators and means of implementation, in order to take advantage of this window of opportunity for institutional strengthening of machineries for the advancement of women\" (See report: http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/42120/S1700853_en.pdf)       Governments also reiterated \"their commitment to designing and implementing gender plans and policies that are coordinated with national sustainable development strategies and have targets, indicators and adequate budgets\".  (See report: http://repositorio.cepal.org/bitstream/handle/11362/42120/S1700853_en.pdf )      In accordance with these agreements, ECLAC organized during the Fifty-sixth meeting of the Presiding Officers of the RCW a High-level panel on the implementation of gender equality plans in the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development where governments shared their experiences, lesson learnt and challenges. Strengthening the institutional architecture and intersectoral work, promoting a participatory process, securing resources, and the implementation of follow-up and monitoring systems were highlighted as key aspects in the design of gender equality plans within the framework of sustainable development.    In this occasion, governments reaffirmed \"the commitment to strengthen the capacities of the machineries for the advancement of women to enter into dialogue and ensure coordination with different government bodies, in particular with ministries of the economy, with a view to mainstreaming the gender perspective in economic policies and budgets, and with ministries of foreign affairs in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\" (See Agreements, https://www.cepal.org/sites/default/files/events/files/agreements_1.pdf).    Finally, ECLAC prepared a document on the interconnections between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Regional Gender Agenda with recommendations to advance towards a comprehensive implementation of gender equality and women's autonomy public policies. The publication \"The 2030 Agenda and the Regional Gender Agenda: Synergies for equality in Latin America and the Caribbean\" has been widely disseminated at intergovernmental meetings such as the 61st session of the Commission on the Status of Women and the First Meeting of the Forum of the Countries of Latin America and the Caribbean on Sustainable Development, the Fifty-Fifth Meeting of the Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean, and its main findings have been incorporated in Division for Gender Affairs presentations delivered to governments, civil society and other stakeholders.
